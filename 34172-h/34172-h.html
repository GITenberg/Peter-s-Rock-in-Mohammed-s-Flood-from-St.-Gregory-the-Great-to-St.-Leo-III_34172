Formation Of Christendom.</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This work being from the beginning one in idea, I place
here together the titles of the fifty-six chapters composing
it. For each of these was intended to be complete
in itself, so far as its special subject reached; but
each was likewise to form a distinct link in a chain.
The Church of God comes before the thoughtful mind
as the vast mass of a kingdom. Its greatest deeds are
but parts of something immeasurably greater. The
most striking evidence of its doctrines and of its works
is cumulative. Those who do not wish to let it so come
before them often confine their interest in very narrow
bounds of time and space. Thus I have known one, who
thought himself a bishop, accept Wycliffe as the answer
of a child to his question, Who first preached the Gospel
in England? And not only this. They also seize upon a
particular incident, or person, and so invest with extraordinary
importance facts which they suppose, and
which so conceived are convenient for their purpose, but
in historical truth are anything but undisputed. In this
tone of mind, or shortness of vision, that which is
gigantic becomes puny, that which is unending becomes
transient. The sequel and coherence of nations, the
mighty roll of the ages spoken of by St. Augustine, are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevi">[pg vi]</span><a name="Pgvi" id="Pgvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
lost sight of. Again, in English-speaking countries alone
more than two hundred sects call themselves Christian.
Their enjoyment of perfect civil freedom and equality
veils to them the horror of doctrinal anarchy, in virtue
of which alone they exist. By this anarchy the very conception
of unity as the corollary of truth is lost to the
popular mind. But through the eight centuries of
which I have treated, the loss of unity was the one conclusive
test of falsehood, and the Christian Faith stood
out to its possessors with the fixed solidity of a mountain
range whose summit pierced the heaven.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been my purpose to exhibit the profound unity
of the Christian Faith together with the infinite variety
of its effects on individual character, on human society,
on the action of nations towards each other, on universal
as well as national legislation. Like the figure of the
great Mother of God bearing her Divine Son in her arms,
and so including the Incarnation and all its works, the
Faith stands before us in history, <span class="tei tei-q">“veste deaurata, circumdata
varietate”</span>. And as the personal unity appears
in the symbol of the Divine Love to man expressed in
her Maternity, so it appears also in the figure of the
Church through the ages in which that Divine Love
executes His work. A divided creed means a marred
gospel and an incredulous world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I offer this work as a single stone, though costing
the labour of thirty years, if perchance it may be accepted
in the structure of that Cathedral of human thought and
action wherein our Crucified God is the central figure,
around which all has grown.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevii">[pg vii]</span><a name="Pgvii" id="Pgvii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Be it allowed me to quote here words of the present
Sovereign Pontiff addressed on the 18th August, 1883,
to the Cardinals de Luca, Pitra, and Hergenröther:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">It is the voice of all history that God with the most
careful providence directs the various and never-ending
movements of human affairs. Even against man's intention
he makes them serve the advancement of His
Church. History says further that the Roman Pontificate
has ever escaped victorious from its contests and the
violence employed against it, while its assaulters have
failed in the hope which they cherished, and have
wrought their own destruction. Not less openly does
history attest the divine provision made concerning the
city of Rome from its very beginning. This was to give
for ever a home and seat to the successors of St. Peter,
from which as a centre, being free from all control of a
superior, they might guide the whole Christian commonwealth.
And no one has ventured to resist this counsel
of the divine Providence without sooner or later perceiving
the vanity of his efforts.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">It cannot be expedient, nor is it wise counsel, to fight
with a power for whose perpetuity God has pledged
Himself, while history attests the performance of the
pledge. Since Catholics throughout the whole world
pay it religious veneration, it is their interest to defend
it with all their power. Nay even the rulers of secular
governments must acknowledge this, and lay it to heart,
especially in times so dangerous, when the very foundations
on which human society rests appear well nigh to
shake and totter.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have hitherto conducted the history of the Throne of
the Fisherman built by the Carpenter's Son in unbroken
succession from St. Peter to St. Gregory the Great. It
is a period of 575 years from the Day of Pentecost <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>
29 to St. Gregory's death in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 604. This period is
very nearly bisected by the conversion of Constantine.
The first half contains the action of the Primacy over
against a hostile heathen empire. The second half
contains its action upon an empire which, at least in
principle, acknowledged union with the Catholic Church
as a duty, a privilege, and a necessity. The testimony
rendered by Councils and by Fathers to the Roman
Primacy may be said to be complete in the time of St.
Gregory. Subsequent Councils can only add a closer
precision to the testimony of the Council of Chalcedon.
Subsequent acts of the Eastern empire can scarcely go
beyond the submission of its episcopate, its emperor,
and its nobles to Pope Hormisdas. The point of that
submission consists in the solemn acceptance of the line
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Roman bishops as inheriting the charge given by our
Lord to St. Peter. Subsequent legislation can but apply
in detail the acceptance by Justinian of the Pope's right
to examine everything which belongs to the doctrine or
concerns the conduct of the Church throughout the
world. And force is even added to this acceptance,
because it was made when the Pope, John II., to whom
it was made, was not in fact his temporal subject.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I propose to treat in this volume of a period embracing
two hundred years. It runs from the time of St. Gregory
the Great to the founding of the holy Roman empire, in
the person of Charlemagne, by Pope St. Leo III.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, before entering on this treatment, it seems to
me called for to make one remark on all which I have
hitherto written or am hereafter to write, and to draw
out distinctly a principle which affects every line of my
narrative. This is the necessity of considering the
Church as the one kingdom of Christ in all ages: one
and the same polity from the Day of Pentecost to the
Day of Judgment. This idea has always been before
me as the rule of faith in writing the six preceding
volumes. It has been the major premiss of my whole
argument. To a Catholic the unity of the Church is as
necessary as the unity of God; and, equally, to say that
the Church is fallible is to deny the existence of any
such thing as the kingdom of God upon earth. The
sooner that anything which is fallible is swept away the
better. The one duty which we owe to fallibility is to
label it. The thing called public opinion<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a>
is fallible, and,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
accordingly, every generation sweeps it away and substitutes
a fresh fallibility, destined to disappear after a
similar ascendency, which waxes and wanes in varying
durations of time. Division is the strongest proof of
fallibility in that which is divided, as unity is of truth
in that which remains one mass. For this cause those
who substitute national churches in a particular country
under the political head of that country, whether king,
president, or parliament, for the one divine polity in all
countries, are divided from my argument by an impassable
gulf. They no more believe in the Church
which is <span class="tei tei-q">“the house of God, the pillar and basis of the
truth,”</span> than he who sets up three gods believes in one
Infinite Creator and Rewarder of His creatures. The
decrees of a General Council in matters of faith are not
recognised by them as part of the divine deposit; for to
them they are not acts of the Sovereign Lord in His
plenary council. The lessons of history fail to convey
any definite impressions to minds in which this idea is
wanting. Rather the lessons of history affect them as
the heathen was affected who heard the description of
our Lord's sufferings undergone for his redemption only
to exclaim, <span class="tei tei-q">“Was it not a long time ago?”</span> There are
facts, but no connection. A strong instance of this is
that the want of written records in the first three
centuries is not made up to them by the acts of the
Church in the fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries, because
to them the Church is not a polity instinct with one life
and following from the beginning identical rules of
government. On the contrary, they argue from the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
silence of perished documents in the three earliest
centuries against the recorded practice of the three
centuries following. Thus to them the acts of the
Church in the Council of Ephesus in 431,<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> the next
ecumenical council to the Nicene, throw no light upon
the acts of the Church in the Nicene, of which no full
record exists. Nor, again, do the acts of the Council of
Chalcedon illustrate to them the antecedent constitution
of the Church. And the supplication of the Eastern
emperor, Marcian, to Pope St. Leo to confirm those acts
tells them nothing as to the relation of the Council to
the Pope in the time of the Nicene Council. Less even
than infidels, who reject the Christian revelation altogether,
but have a regard for historical sequence, do the
nurslings of a national church, especially if it was in
origin a queen's love-child, and then dandled on the
knees of successive kings, understand the majesty of the
Apostolic See, as set forth in the words of our Lord, or
as unfolded in the course of ages. If the political constitution
under which they live be a system of compromise,
they are tempted to make the constitution of
the Church a similar system, in which a change of

Therefore they fail to appreciate the proof of the one
polity at the head of which St. Peter's successor stands.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
For some that polity ceased to exist in the fifth century;
for others in the ninth; for others in the sixteenth; for
all such it is non-existent in the nineteenth. It is for
them as the human soul for the infidel surgeon: he
cannot find it under his knife. Or as God for the
infidel astronomer: he cannot see God in the order of
the universe, though he will receive what physicists tell
him, that the universe is absolutely one.

During the whole pontificate of St. Gregory he was
defending himself against the deceit and despotism of
the man whom he acknowledged as his lawful sovereign,
the Byzantine emperor. The despotism usually veiled
itself in deceit, while the deceit rested upon the
despotism rooted in the heart of the eastern that he was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
lord of the world.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> Worse than the Lombards, who
pursued to the very gates of Rome the people nourished
by Gregory on the Church's patrimonium, who spoiled,
maimed, and tortured those whom they could catch,
were the intrigues of the imperial lieutenants, the
exarchs of Ravenna, plotting with the Lombards,
enemies of the emperor, against his subjects, the Pope
and his Romans. With this state of things the seventh
century begins, and so it continues to the end. We
have to consider the great events which took place in
this century, and especially to point out their connection
with this fact of the Byzantine temporal despotism as it
was turned upon the spiritual power.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, during his whole pontificate, St. Gregory was
resisting the attempts of the bishops of Constantinople
to extend their power. In his own time it would seem
to have been an effect of Justinian's legislation that the
Roman See accepted them as patriarchs, which Pope
Gelasius denied them to be. Not only so but in every
step of their advancement they were backed by the
emperors to go on yet further by pushing their See
under the title of Ecumenical to a position over the
eastern empire parallel to that of the Pope over the
West, while it was subordinate at the same time to the
emperor himself. The four-and-twenty immediate successors
of St. Gregory, from Pope Sabinian, elected in
604, to Pope Constantine, who died in 715, were exposed
to the full force of this attempt. The bearing of it upon
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the rise of the Mohammedan empire will appear more
and more as we proceed in the history of this terrible
century.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first event on which we must dwell for a time
on account of its great effect upon the history of the
century, is the long continued hostility between the
eastern and the Persian empires. In the year 602 the
general Phocas had deposed the emperor Mauritius.<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a>
From his reign most Byzantine historians date the ever
increasing calamities of the empire. The popular feeling
that a bad ruler is a judgment from God was expressed
in the story that a pious monk once asked, O God, why
hast Thou set this man over us as emperor? when he
received for answer, Because I could find none worse.
Phocas reigned about seven years, and his end was as
follows. The patriarch Thomas had, by his entreaties,
drawn to Constantinople Theodore of Siceon, who enjoyed
a great reputation for holiness. The mind of patriarch
Thomas had been greatly moved by auguries of misfortune
which as it were filled the air. He urged the
saint to pray and then to give him his advice. The
saint at last yielded to his entreaties and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“It was
my mind not to disturb you. It is not for your good
to know these things. But since you will have it so,
learn that the incident which troubles you betokens
many great misfortunes. Many will leave our religion.
Incursions of barbarians will follow, and great blood-shedding.
Devastation and insurrection through the
whole world. Churches will be deserted. The fall of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the divine service and of the empire is approaching: and
the adversary is nigh at hand.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whilst St. Theodore was at Constantinople the
emperor Phocas suffered from gout in hands and feet.
He sent for the saint, who laid his hands upon him and
prayed for him. The emperor felt relief, and commended
himself and his realm to Theodore's prayers. The
saint replied that if he wished such a prayer to be
heard he must cease from oppression and shedding of
blood. Phocas had great need of such warning, but
profited little by it. Narses was the ablest and bravest
general whom he had to send against the Persians, but
he broke his word, and had him burnt alive. This frightful
execution moved the patrician Germanus to try after
the place of emperor which Phocas had once offered to
him. He planned a conspiracy with Constantina, widow
of the emperor Mauritius. She had taken asylum with
her daughters in Sancta Sophia. This was in 606. At
the sight of her the people flocked together and took
up arms. Phocas sent orders to bring out Constantina
with her daughters. The patriarch Cyriakus refused:
only when he had compelled Phocas to swear that no
harm should be done to them, he gave them up. Phocas
kept his word, and only confined them in a monastery.
Germanus was forced to become a priest. In the next
year, 607, Germanus and Constantina with other persons
of high rank made a new conspiracy. It was discovered.
Germanus with his daughter, the widow of prince
Theodosius, eldest son of the preceding emperor Mauritius,
was beheaded. The same lot befel Constantina and her
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
daughters at Chalcedon, on the spot where, five years
before, the emperor Mauritius had witnessed the execution
of five sons, one after another, uttering at each stroke
only the words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Just art Thou, O Lord, and just is
Thy judgment”</span>: and then offering his own head to the
sword. Phocas put to death the other conspirators with
fearful tortures. Such executions were followed by fresh
conspiracies, and these by similar punishments. At last,
Crispus, the very stepson of Phocas, rose against him,
and invited Heraclius, governor of Africa, to depose the
emperor. Heraclius despatched a fleet under the command
of his son, bearing the same name. Only as it drew
near Constantinople did Phocas hear of it. He prepared
for defence, but Crispus secretly traversed all his efforts,
pretending to be on his side. After a bloody engagement
the fleet appeared before the walls of the capital
on Sunday the 4th October, 610. The next morning
a senator, whose wife Phocas had dishonoured, appeared
with a troop of soldiers at the palace. Phocas was seized,
stripped of the purple, his hands bound behind his back,
and carried through the city and the fleet before the
young Heraclius, who was still on board his vessel.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Wretch,”</span> said Heraclius, <span class="tei tei-q">“hast thou governed the
empire so?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“And wilt thou,”</span> answered Phocas, <span class="tei tei-q">“govern
it better?”</span> Heraclius trampled on him, cut off his
hands and feet, and then his head, in sight of the vast
throng which lined the shore. His head and limbs were
carried on spears through the city, the trunk dragged
through the streets, and all at last burnt.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Heraclius, accompanied by Crispus, disembarked. He
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
invited Crispus to put on the imperial robe, since he
was not come to invest himself with it, but only to
avenge Mauritius and his children. Crispus refused,
and then Heraclius had nothing to oppose to the request
of the patriarch Sergius, who had just succeeded Thomas,
that he should be crowned by him. Crispus was given
the government of Cappadocia: but becoming a few
years later unfaithful to Heraclius, as he had been to
his stepfather Phocas, was compelled to receive the
torture, and pass the rest of his days in banishment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may here be said that the dynasty thus begun
occupied the throne for five generations. Justinian II.,
great-great-grandson of Heraclius, was more cruel if
possible, than Phocas: he was deposed by an adventurer
in 695, and his nose cut off to incapacitate him for any
future recovery of the throne. His successor lasted three
years: and another for seven; after which Justinian,
who wore a golden nose for the one which he had lost,
recovered the throne; practised during five years atrocious
cruelties, was deposed by a third adventurer,
Philippicus Bardanes in 711: put to death, and his
head carried to Rome to assure all men that they were
delivered from a tyrant, and a special oppressor of the
Church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such in personal conduct was the manner of men who
sat on the eastern throne of the great Constantine during
the seventh century: whom four-and-twenty Popes found
themselves bound to acknowledge as <span class="tei tei-q">“Christian kings
and Roman princes”</span>. What they were in this capacity,
which was the first and greatest of all their duties, as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
recognised by the imperial laws, will be seen as the
narrative proceeds. Under these men the Popes, utterly
deprived of temporal power, in the midst of a province
an outlying domain of a distant despot, had to maintain
the unity of the Christian faith, and the independence
of the Holy See as its guardian. In the midst of these
things the chalifs of Mohammed broke upon the eastern
empire, and severed from it its fairest provinces. It is
requisite to follow closely the series of events, and the
connection of times.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Upon his accession to the throne in 603 Phocas had
sent an embassy to the Persian emperor Chosroes,
expressing his desire to maintain peace with him. But
Chosroes under pretext of avenging his benefactor, the
late emperor Mauritius, began a war which lasted more
than four and twenty years, inflicted fearful sufferings
on both empires, and had the most important consequences
by leaving them in a state of great weakness to
meet the assault of a new enemy, the Mohammedan
chalifate.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During the first eighteen years of this war, that is,
from 604 to 622, the Greek empire suffered a series of
defeats and disasters. Through the whole East, from
the ruins of Babylon to the Bosphorus, cities were
burnt and destroyed, the country ravaged and left
without cultivation, the inhabitants slain or carried
away into slavery. The Persians tore from the empire
province after province—Armenia, Mesopotamia, Cappadocia.
In 610 they came up to the walls of Chalcedon.
The accession of Heraclius produced no pause in their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
destructive course. In 611 they took Edessa, Apamea,
and Antioch. In 615 they plundered Palestine, and
took Jerusalem. The Church of Gethsemane, on the
Mount of Olives, and Constantine's Basilica of the Holy
Sepulchre were destroyed or burnt. Among the inhabitants
carried away was the patriarch Zacharias.
The Persians seized in plunder all that was valuable,
and the priceless relic of the Holy Cross was taken
away by the fire-worshipper Chosroes. The Sponge and
the Lance were saved by the patrician Nicetas, who
purchased them at a high price from a Persian soldier,
and then brought them to Constantinople, where they
were exposed for veneration of the faithful.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is to be noted that in 610 the Jews at Antioch had
an insurrection, and massacred a great number of the
most considerable inhabitants. They seized the patriarch
Anastasius II., whom we have seen St. Gregory treat
with such regard; they frightfully maimed him, dragged
him by the feet through his city, and finished by casting
him upon a funeral pile. When Jerusalem was captured
in 615, the Jews of Palestine bought of the Persians as
many Christians as they could get, for the pleasure of
strangling them. It is recorded that they murdered
seventy thousand in this manner.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Eight days before the taking of Jerusalem the fortress
monastery of Mar Sabas, 2000 feet above the Dead
Sea, then, as now, of the greatest renown, was assaulted
by the Arabs. All but fourty-four of the oldest monks
had fled, but these remained, and, after its capture,
suffered first grievous tortures, and at last martyrdom.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
When the monks who had fled returned, they found the
bodies of their brethren unburied; the abbot Modestus
gave them holy burial. He afterwards superintended
the diocese of Jerusalem during the absence of the
captive patriarch. What Monte Cassino is to Italy,
and Mount Athos to Greece, Mar Sabas was then and is
now to Palestine.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At this time St. John the Almsgiver—the last great
patriarch of Alexandria—gave every help to the fugitives
from the Persian seizure of the Holy Land. It
is a sign of the secular power wielded by the Egyptian
patriarch that he ordered the confiscation of the goods
of those who used in his city false weights and measures.
After he had lovingly received and supported the fugitives
from Syria and Palestine, he had, in the next year,
616, to fly himself in order to escape the sword of the
Persians. He was on his way with the patrician Nicetas
to Constantinople, when, at Rhodes, he had a vision, in
consequence of which he said to his companion: <span class="tei tei-q">“You
invite me to the king of this world, but the Lord of
heaven comes before you”</span>. He told Nicetas the vision,
and left him to go to Amathus in Cyprus, his birthplace.
There he made his will in these words: <span class="tei tei-q">“I thank
Thee, O Lord, that Thou hast heard my prayer, and
that only one-third of one gold piece remains to me,
though at my consecration I found 8000 pounds' weight
of gold in the bishop's house at Alexandria, not reckoning
those countless sums which I have received from
the friends of Christ. Therefore, I order that this small
remnant be given to Thy servants.”</span> Ten years he sat
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the See of Alexandria. George was his successor.
But from this time nothing more is known of this
Church's history. Alexandria fell first under the
Persians, and then under Amrou, the Mohammedan.
The Arabian domination supported Christian errors
only, and from that time the Church of St. Athanasius
has never lifted its head again, and the land of the
Desert Fathers is become the chief seat of the religion
which puts an impostor in the place of the Redeemer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the year 616, the Persians broke into Egypt, took
and plundered Alexandria, and carried their ravages to
the borders of Æthiopia. Another Persian army besieged
Chalcedon. Still Heraclius remained inactive.
He only sent an embassy to Chosroes. In 619 he sent
another, beseeching mercy in the name of the senate.
Chosroes replied: <span class="tei tei-q">“I will spare the Romans when they
renounce their Crucified One and worship the sun”</span>.
He remembered not that he had to thank the Romans
for his crown, that in his time of trouble he had found
help only from the God of the Christians. Heraclius
lost courage at this answer. Since the loss of Egypt
Constantinople was suffering from famine, as well as a
grievous pestilence. The emperor resolved to quit his
capital, and take refuge with his father in Africa. He
embarked his chief treasures, and directed the fleet to
Carthage. Most of it was wrecked in a storm. A
panic fell on his people, and they besought him with
tears and cries not to forsake them. The patriarch
Sergius went to the palace, led Heraclius to Sancta
Sophia, and compelled him before the altar to swear
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
aloud not to desert his capital. Heraclius submitted
against his will.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In 619 he was very nearly taken captive by the
Khan of the Avars, who had asked him for an interview,
ostensibly to settle terms of peace, in reality to
secure his person and riches, and to fall upon Constantinople.
The emperor came in great pomp, was surprised,
and scarcely escaped in disguise. The Avars obtained
an immense booty, and, according to the patriarch
Nicephorus, carried away captive beyond the Danube
270,000 men, women, and children.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At length, in the twelfth year of his reign, Heraclius
awoke from his torpor, and his awakening was one of
the most marvellous events recorded in history. His
treasury was empty and his credit not good enough to
borrow; but he resolved to attack the Persians in their
own country. To secure Constantinople he made peace
with the Avars, and to hold them in check he ceded
provinces to other races, Slaves, Croatians, and Servians.
He made churches and monasteries supply a forced
loan. He took even the candlesticks and holy vessels
of Sancta Sophia and coined them. When all was
ready for his departure, he declared his eldest son,
Heraclius Constantinus, ten years old, regent of the
kingdom under tutorship of Sergius the patriarch and
Bonosus, patrician. Then he celebrated the Easter
festival, 4th April, 622. The next day he went to
Sancta Sophia, threw himself before the altar and cried:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Lord, deliver us not for the punishment of our transgressions
to our enemies, but look upon us in Thy
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mercy and grant us victory, that the wicked cease to
exalt themselves and to mock Thine inheritance”</span>.
Then he turned to the patriarch Sergius with the words:
<span class="tei tei-q">“My city and my son I leave to God's protection, the
Blessed Virgin's, and thine”</span>. Upon this he took into
his hands an image of our Saviour, which was said not
to have been made by hands, marched to the Bosphorus
and crossed over to Asia.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A train of defeats by the Persians had demoralised
the Greek soldiers. Heraclius reinforced his army with
allied troops, amongst them a number of Turks. He
spent some months at first in restoring courage to his
forces. <span class="tei tei-q">“See,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“my children, how the enemies
of God trample on our land, lay waste our cities, burn
our sanctuaries, desecrate our altars, pollute our churches
with the vilest abominations.”</span> When he had thus
enheartened them he reviewed them together, and
swore to fight with them and on equal terms unto
death, to share all their dangers, to be inseparable from
them as a father with his children. And moreover, he
kept his word.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Heraclius was ever at the head of his soldiers: he
united valour with caution: he entered Armenia and
defeated the Persians in several battles. Then he made
a show of taking up his winter-quarters in Pontus, but
suddenly burst into Persia, and utterly discomfited a
large force. He took the enemy's camp, together with
immense treasure. His troops were astounded at their
own victories, and he wintered them in Armenia. The
next campaign was no less glorious. He kept Easter
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Day in 623, which fell on the 27th March, with his
family at Nicomedia. By the 20th April he was in
Persia. He had written to Chosroes, and offered him
peace. The Persian king not only rejected his offer,
but put the bearers of it to death. Heraclius used all
these circumstances to give courage and confidence to
his troops. He penetrated to the heart of Persia: he
burnt the cities and villages which he passed on his
way, and marched on Ganzac, now Tauris, where
Chosroes was encamped with forty thousand men.
At the first onset, Chosroes took flight. His troops
were mown down, captured, or scattered. Ganzac was
the capital of Atropatene. The Persian kings kept
there a treasure, said to be that of Crœsus and to
have been brought thither by Cyrus. The most
renowned fire-temple of the chief god of the Persians
was in this city. Here Zoroaster, the founder of that
worship, had been born and lived. There was also
here a colossal statue of Chosroes. He was seated in
the middle of the palace under a great baldachin
representing heaven. Round him were the sun, moon
and stars, and angels bearing sceptres. The statue, by
means of machinery, caused rain to fall, and thunder to
sound. In fact, Chosroes assumed here divine worship.
The emperor ordered the statue to be overthrown and
broken to pieces. Heraclius burnt palace and temple,
with part of the city. Then he marched into Albania
for the winter, and, out of pity, set free fifty thousand
Persian prisoners, to whom he likewise gave maintenance.
This humanity so won their hearts that they burst
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
into tears, and prayed that he might restore freedom
to Persia, and put to flight Chosroes, whom they called
the Waster of the human race—so hateful had he
made himself by oppression and cruelty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the campaign of 624, Chosroes brought up three
armies against the emperor. Heraclius defeated them
in three great battles. He made so sudden a night
attack upon what remained that their general, Sarbar,
wakened by the clash of arms, had scarcely time to
spring from his bed on horseback, and ride away at
full speed, while the conqueror took possession of his
golden shield, and even his clothes. In his fourth
campaign, that of 625, Heraclius was also victorious.
Chosroes avenged the defeat of his troops by falling on
the churches of Persia, which he stripped of all their
ornaments: and to punish the emperor, he compelled
the Christians of his realm to become Nestorians.
Fifteen years before, he had, to please his physician,
compelled the inhabitants of Edessa to become Eutycheans.
Chosroes rallied all his forces for the campaign
of 626. He raised three great armies, composed indifferently
of freemen and slaves, of natives and foreigners.
Sarbar led one of these armies to Chalcedon to
besiege Constantinople, on the Asiatic side, while the
Khan of the Avars, breaking truce, appeared on the
European side, to demand the surrender of the city and
all its wealth. Its inhabitants, however, defended
themselves with such valour as to repulse both Avars
and Persians. The fall of the Avar power begins at
this moment. It was henceforth occupied by intestine
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
struggles. Sais led the second army of Chosroes, which
was defeated by Theodore, brother of the emperor
Heraclius. Heraclius himself broke the third army under
the command of Rhazates, at Nineveh, on the 12th
December, 627. The battle began in early morning,
and ended only in the evening. The Persians lost,
besides the commanding general, his three lieutenants,
almost all their officers, and nearly the half of their
soldiers. The Romans had only fifty killed, but many
thousands wounded. These the emperor tended with
so much care that only ten died.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nineveh, at that time, was only a village on the
ruins of the old capital. Heraclius marched thence
upon Ctesiphon, the capital of Persia, built upon the
remains of old Babylon, at a little distance. On his
road he passed palaces, seats, and chaces wherein the
Persian nobles pursued their hunting. Heraclius
suffered his soldiers to sack and burn them all.
Chosroes fled from city to city. Heraclius made
him new peace-proposals at the beginning of 628.
Chosroes refused them all, and became perfectly hated
by the Persians. He thought not of the justice of God,
which was pursuing him. Thirty-eight years before
he had murdered his father Hermisdas to obtain his
throne. What he had done to his father was to happen
to him from his eldest son. He had been struck by a
violent dysentery: and wished to make Medarses, his
son by his favourite wife Syra, a Christian, his successor
in the throne. His eldest son, Siroes, irritated by
this preference, gained the nobles and the army, was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
proclaimed king, and sent an embassy to Heraclius.
Chosroes was captured in his flight, and brought to
Ctesiphon, on the 24th February, 628. He was put in
chains and imprisoned in the strong tower, Tenebres,
which he had built to keep his treasures. The next
day Siroes was crowned: the first act of his government
was to condemn his father to die of starvation.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Let him eat,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“the gold for which he has
desolated the world, and condemned so many to die of
hunger.”</span> The Satraps and all his enemies were made
to mock the fallen ruler, and spit in his face. Siroes
ordered Medarses and all his brethren to be strangled
before his father's eyes: and, as the old king was still
living on the fifth day, had him shot to death with
arrows. So ended Chosroes, king of Persia, murdered
by his son as he murdered his father.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These victories the emperor Heraclius reported at
Constantinople, and also sent a letter, in which Siroes
announced his coronation, and proclaimed his wish for
peace. This letter was read from the ambo of Sancta
Sophia on the Feast of Pentecost, 15th May, 628.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Siroes, in fact, established a stable peace with the
emperor. He restored him all Christian prisoners in
Persia, among them, Zacharias, patriarch of Jerusalem.
He delivered to him also the true Cross, which Sarbar
had taken away fourteen years before at the capture of
Jerusalem. This was at first carried to Constantinople:
but in the following year, 629, the emperor took ship to
bring it back to Jerusalem, and give thanks to God for his
victories. Here he replaced the Cross on its old spot.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
It had remained in its case, as it was taken away. The
patriarch, with his clergy, recognised the seal as intact,
opened with its key the shrine, worshipped the Cross,
and showed it to the people. The Church celebrates,
by the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, this event
on the same day, the 14th September, on which she
had before celebrated the apparition of the Cross to
Constantine. Heraclius, in the same year, came to
Edessa, and restored to the Catholics the church which
Chosroes had given to the Nestorians. And he paid
back, in the shape of a yearly income to Sancta Sophia
and its clergy, the sums which he had borrowed for the
costs of the war.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us dwell for a moment on these acts of Heraclius,
from 622 to 629.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No Roman emperor, in the course of many hundred
years, during the whole time in which Rome and Persia
stood as rivals over against each other, obtained such
a triumph over the king of kings, as did Heraclius.
He surpassed by far Trajan at the culmination of the
empire. Heraclius, commending his city and his son
to the protection of God, of our Blessed Lady, and of
the bishop of his city, God's representative, went forth
on what seemed a desperate expedition, borrowing from
churches and monasteries the means to equip it. For
seven years victory crowned his course. Trajan stopped
at the Mesopotamian provinces. Julian perished in them.
Mark Antony won no honour of Rome's eastern rival:
Crassus and his host never returned. Galerius was
stuffed and served as a footstool for the great king to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mount on horseback. Into the heart of that eastern
realm Heraclius threw himself fearlessly. He made his
own army out of divers peoples, and shared their dangers.
Host after host he overthrew, as only the son of Philip,
the conqueror without his match, had done before him.
In the end, on the very spot where a Roman emperor,
the special despiser of the Nazarene, and fostering in
his heart the destruction of the Church as the crowning
work of his reign, to be achieved upon his return as
conqueror, perished by a Persian lance, Heraclius, after
driving to despair the great king, the persecutor of the
Cross, its possessor by conquest, saw him dethroned,
famished, and at last shot to death by his son. He
received from that son, the successor of the murdered
father, abundant satisfaction for the wrongs which the
Roman empire had suffered from its great rival of so
many hundred years.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, moreover, during these very seven years in which
Heraclius won a perpetual victory in the name of the
Cross—the wood of which he brought back as a conqueror
to Jerusalem, giving thanks and worship, and replaced
it with the seal which guarded it unbroken in its old
sanctuary—an Arabian trafficker who had gained his
living by carrying goods from city to city, and lived
virtuously with one wife much his elder, upon her death,
when he was more than fifty years of age, was assuming
the name of a prophet and the position of a conqueror.
The year in which Heraclius started is the same in which
this pretension was set up. His claim to be a prophet
is exactly coincident with the years in which he was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
taking to himself wife after wife, in which, entering
suddenly the tent of his adopted son, he was seduced
by a casual glance on that wife's beauty to desire her,
to obtain her, and to forge a permission from the Most
High to take as many wives as he pleased, and the wives
of others—a forgery as yet unique in all the history of
imposture; for many bad men have taken the wives of
others, but no one except Mohammed has pretended to
have a divine sanction for an act which treads under foot
all human justice, and pulls down for the lust of one
man the very foundation of domestic life.

As eighteen years of continual defeat by the Persians,
from 604 to 622, had reduced the Eastern empire to a
state of demoralised weakness, so the seven succeeding
years, from 622 to 629, in which Heraclius wrought a
full revenge on the Persian king, inflicted no passing
collapse upon the empire resuscitated by the Sassanides
in the third century. King Siroes did not long enjoy
the fruit of his parricide. He reigned six months and
then he died—some say of the plague, some of remorse.
After his death the throne of Persia seemed to become a
seat of murder. His young son, Ardeschir, or Artaxerxes,
was killed after reigning seven months by his
uncle, the general Sarbar. Sarbar kept the throne two
months and was killed. Devanschir took his place.
He was followed by Borane, a daughter of Chosroes.
She was replaced by a certain Tschaschindeh, who was
followed by Borane's sister, Azermidokt. A certain
Kesra, or Chosroes, succeeded, and he gave way to a
Ferokzad. Finally, Jezdedjerd, a grandson of the last
Chosroes, was crowned in the year 632. Thus in the
short space of four years about nine persons succeeded
to the throne by murder. Jezdedjerd III. began his
reign in the year Mohammed died. He is called by
Theophanes, Hormisdas. He had the honour to be the
last king of Persia and to end his days by the sword of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Arab in 651. His son, Peroxes, became a captain
in the life-guards of the emperor of China at Singapore,
and left no posterity.

After this glimpse at the action of the Byzantine and
Persian empires on each other during the thirty years
which follow immediately on the death of St. Gregory,
we turn to consider the conduct of the temporal liege-lord
of the Pope towards him whom he recognised as
successor of St. Peter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The emperor Phocas, following in this his predecessor
Justinian, had expressly enjoined on the patriarch of
Constantinople to recognise the Primacy of Rome.<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a>
What the chroniclers remark is important, that Boniface
III., the next to succeed St. Gregory, received a decree
from Phocas, in which he solemnly declared that the
See of the Roman Church was to be considered the head
of Christendom. It may be remarked here that Phocas
did not say a word more than his predecessor, Marcian,
said to St. Leo a hundred and fifty years before.
Phocas may be named a tyrant, but Marcian has left an
unspotted reputation as a Christian king and Roman
prince, who received the empire with the hand of
Pulcheria, heiress of the great Theodosius, and the
only descendant worthy of his greatness, whose name
stands also on the diptychs of the Catholic Church as
a virgin saint.<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a>

With the death of the great Pontiff, who guarded and
fed his city while the calamities which he saw all round
the sphere of his vision over the whole Church led him
to look for the end of the world, the See of Peter remained
half a year unfilled until his successor, Sabinianus
of Volterra, formerly Papal Nuncio at the Byzantine
court, received the confirmation of his election from the
exarch or the emperor. The confirmation of each pope's
election was, as a rule, obtained either from the exarch
or direct from the emperor. It was a business both
costly and protracted. It also made the spiritual head
of Rome dependent for his recognition on the imperial
court. I find that in the period of 111 years, running
from the death of St. Gregory in 604 to the death of
Pope Constantine in 715, twenty-four popes succeeded.
Of these the first, Sabinian, in 604, had to wait six months.
Phocas confirmed the election of Boniface III., the next
pope, after a year. He died in November, 607, and
Boniface IV. following took his seat in August, 608.
When he died, Pope Deusdedit waited five months. At
his death Boniface V. succeeded after a year, in 619.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Pope Honorius followed Boniface in five days and sat
during thirteen years, but at his death the confirmation
of his successor, Pope Severinus, was delayed by
Greek intrigue, and for a purpose hereafter to be mentioned,
during nineteen months and sixteen days, so
that he only sat from the 28th May to the 1st August,
640. St. Martin in 649 did not wait for the imperial
confirmation; he was first banished and then martyred
by the emperor Constans II., who put in by threats his
successor, Eugenius, during his lifetime. St. Leo II.
waited eighteen months in 682, after the death of Pope
Agatho, and the next Pope, Benedict II., a year in 684.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This privation of its original freedom, according to
which the Pope's consecration followed at once upon his
complete and legitimate election by clergy and people,
the Roman Church owed to the Arian Herule Odoacer,
during his occupation of Italy. It was eagerly grasped,
after Theodorich and Theodatus had exercised it, by
Justinian, when he became, by conquest, lord of Rome.
I have already recorded the infamous violence exerted
by Belisarius as soon as he had entered Rome, at the
bidding of the Empress Theodora, upon St. Silverius.
Now we have the eastern emperors, through the seventh
century, exerting, sometimes directly, sometimes by
delegation to their exarch, this stolen privilege. It
was taken by Odoacer ostensibly for the preservation of
order in the election, and the prevention of violence.
I suppose it is the furthest reach of disloyalty to exercise
a power which has been entrusted for protection to the
injury of the party protected. This disloyalty was perpetually
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
shown by the eastern emperors to the Popes,
whose Primacy over the Church they acknowledged,
until they finally lost the opportunity by the new-creation
of the Western empire, and the acquisition of
temporal sovereignty by the Popes.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the accession of Honorius I., in 625, it is stated
to have been the custom, upon the death of a Pope,
that the Archpriest, the Archdeacon, and the first of
the Notaries signified his death to the exarch. The
Acts of the new election, subscribed by clergy and
laity, were deposited in the archives of the Lateran.
A copy of them was sent to the emperor. The report
sent to the exarch was the more important. This
Viceroy of Italy was humbly besought for his consent:
nay, even the Archbishop and Judges of Ravenna were
asked to obtain it from him. The clergy and people of
Rome had to look to the exarch, the emperor's delegate,
even more than to the emperor, since he stood in more
immediate relation to Rome, and determined the decision
of the Byzantine court. The Romans, suffering
from the delay of their bishop's consecration,
would entreat the emperor to lessen the time of
disturbance by allowing the exarch to confirm their
choice.<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the short pontificates of the Popes, who sat from
St. Gregory to Honorius, we may note one remarkable
fact. Full six centuries after its erection by Agrippa,
as the vestibule of his baths in the centre of the Campus
Martius, stood what was called the Pantheon, with its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
superb portico of granite pillars and white marble
capitals, untouched in their beauty—the fairest relic of
ancient Rome. It had withstood all the inundations of
the Tiber: all the devastations of the Gothic war: all
the injuries of time. Every winter the floods forced
themselves up over its floor: day and night the dome,
through its aperture, received the waters of heaven.
The images of Augustus<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> and Agrippa probably stood still
in their niches: the beams of gilded brass supported its
roof, covered with the gilt tiles of bronze, which neither
Vandal, nor Goth, nor Byzantine robber had yet carried
away. Pliny had given it the name of Pantheon: Dio
Cassius had seen in it the statues of Mars and Venus,
and of the deified Cæsars. A tablet of the Fratres
Arvales has been found, dating from the year 59, in
Nero's time, and showing that worship to the pagan
gods was then offered in it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pope Boniface IV. beheld this wonder of ancient art,
and longed to make a church of that beautiful dome
which hung like the vault of heaven over the broadest
expanse ever covered by a roof. He asked it of the
emperor Phocas, and received it as a gift. He assembled
the clergy of Rome, and a procession, singing hymns,
entered that noble doorway, and the Pope sprinkled
with holy water the marble-encrusted walls, from which
every vestige of heathendom was cleared away. The
<span class="tei tei-q">“Gloria in Excelsis”</span> resounded for the first time in
that dome from which Michael Angelo took his most
beautiful creation. The temple of all the demons was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
purified: and Pope Boniface IV. preserved it for all
succeeding ages, under its dedication to the Ever-virgin
Mother of God, and all martyrs. So it was saved from
becoming, in mediæval times, the hold of some noble
robber. And from it the devotion to All Saints, on
the 1st November, and for All Souls, on the 2nd, was
propagated amongst the nations of the West. What was
originally a Roman festival passed beyond the Alps
and the dome of Agrippa, the partner of Augustus and
the husband of Julia, and through her progenitor of
Cæsars, became the shrine from which the glorious
office of all the saints in the Church triumphant, and
that of intercession for all souls in the Church suffering,
went forth to the Christian world.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From 604 to 625, five Pontiffs had ascended the
Roman chair, and all had to wait, after their election, for
the good pleasure of the Byzantine emperor, that they
should take their seat. In 625, there succeeded a man
of great distinction. He was a Campanian of high birth,
and he strove to follow the example of his master, St.
Gregory. Honorius I. sat for 13 years, and with
Vitalian, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 657-672, and Sergius, 687-701, alone
reached that length of pontificate, while twenty-one
other Popes share between them, including vacancies
and delays interposed by the Byzantine, the remaining
69 years. We have no documents existing to account
for such a number of short pontificates. Honorius
busied himself much in the conversion of the southern
Saxon kingdoms in England, where St. Bede<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> attests
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that the Bishop Birinus came by his instance. Anastasius
gives a long account of the gifts which he bestowed on
the churches of Rome; among them, that he covered
the confession of St. Peter with pure silver, weighing
187 pounds: and the whole church with brazen tiles
which, with the consent of the emperor Heraclius, he
took from the temple of Roma: that he built the church
of St. Agnes, and made her a silver shrine, weighing 252
pounds; also, the church of the Four-crowned. Of his
character, the Abbot Jonas, near his time, writes: he
was <span class="tei tei-q">“a venerable prelate, sagacious, strong in counsel,
clear in doctrine, powerful by his gentleness and
humility”</span>. He also clothed with silver plates, weighing
975 pounds, the middle or royal door of St. Peter's,
on which there was an inscription, calling him <span class="tei tei-q">“Honorius,
the good bishop, the leader of the people. Your own
prelate, blessed Peter, made your doors of silver; O
doorkeeper of heaven, maintain for this in tranquillity
all the times of your flock.”</span> And there, in the great
Basilica, he was buried in all honour.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, in his person, one of the State-made patriarchs
of Constantine's city is able to make the solitary boast
that he once deceived one Roman Pontiff. Sergius,
who sat in that See, from 610 to 638, and who seems
to have obtained as great a mastery over the mind of
the emperor Heraclius as his predecessor, Acacius, had
over the emperor Zeno, constructed a doctrinal exposition
called the Ecthesis, which he induced the emperor
to father and promulgate. He was desirous, above all
things, to obtain the Pope's approval of the doctrine
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which he afterwards set forth in this document. He
wrote to the Pope letters, the purpose of which the
successor of St. Peter, instead of seeing through, appears
to have misconceived. After the death of Honorius,
the Monothelite emperors and patriarchs claimed to
have received the support of that Pope. His not having
detected, and actively condemned the deceit of Sergius,
brought upon the memory of Honorius the heavy rebuke
that Pope St. Leo. II. assented so far to the
sentence of the Sixth General Council in 682, as to
have written to the Spanish bishops:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Those who had
been traitors to the purity of the Apostolic tradition
were punished with eternal condemnation: they are
Theodore of Pharan, Cyrus of Alexandria, Sergius,
Pyrrhus, Paulus, Petrus of Constantinople, together
with Honorius, who, instead of extinguishing, when it
began to arise, the flame of heretical doctrine, fostered
it by his neglect”</span>.<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Much light would appear to be thrown upon the
belief of Pope Honorius by the history of the forty
years succeeding his death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He sat within a few days of thirteen years. He was
buried, says Anastasius, on the 12th October, 638, in
St. Peter's, and the See remained vacant one year seven
months and seventeen days. Why did it so remain
vacant?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The era and the question are both most important
to note. The following narrative<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a> will explain why the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Papal See was kept vacant nineteen months after the
election of a successor to Pope Honorius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the year 638, Sergius, patriarch of Constantinople,
composed in the name of the emperor Heraclius an
edict which he called Ecthesis or exposition, as if it
were merely an exposition of the Catholic faith respecting
the dispute about the One or the Two Operations in
our Lord. He then brought about that the emperor
subscribed and published it. Perhaps Sergius wished
to take advantage of the vacancy in the Papal See to
make the Monothelite error a law of the State, and to
compel the future Pope to subscribe it, for which he
wished to get the imperial subscription making it a law.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Ecthesis begins with a confession of faith in the
Holy Trinity which is quite orthodox. It then enlarges
upon the Incarnation, and draws out the distinction of
the Two Natures and the Unity of the Person. It
proceeds:—<span class="tei tei-q">“We acknowledge one Son and Lord Jesus
Christ, who is at once capable and incapable of suffering,
visible and invisible. We teach that the miracles and
the sufferings belong to one and the same; we ascribe
all divine and human Operation to one and the same
Word become flesh; we offer ... to Him one adoration,
and allow no man to hold and teach either One or
Two Operations in the Divine Incarnation of the Lord;
but rather, according to the tradition of the holy
General Councils, that one and the same only-begotten
Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, works both the divine and
the human actions, and that the whole Operation
belonging at once to God and to man proceeds from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
one and the same Incarnate God, the Word, indivisibly
and unconfusedly, and is to be referred to one and the
same. Since the expression, One Operation, if used by
some fathers, still sounds strange and disturbs the ears
of some who conceive that it is used for the doing away
of the Two Natures personally united in Christ our God,
and in like manner the expression Two Operations
offends many, as not used by any one of the chief
doctors of the Church, and because there follow from it
two Wills opposed to each other, as if God the Word
willed to fulfil His saving passion, while His Manhood
resisted that will of His, and so two are introduced
willing contrary things, an impious thing opposed to
Christian doctrine. For even the impious Nestorius,
though he divided the divine taking of the manhood
from the Lord, and introduced two Sons, did not
venture to speak of two Wills. Rather he taught
identity of will in the two persons invented by him.
How then can they who confess the right faith, and
glorify one Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, the true God,
receive two Wills and those opposed to each other in
Him? Following, therefore, the holy Fathers in all
things and in this, we confess One Will of our Lord
Jesus Christ, the true God, so that at no time did His
Flesh, animated by the mind, make a natural movement
of itself separately and by its own impulse, which was
contrary to the bidding of God the Word personally
united with it; but when and such and as much as
God the Word Himself willed ... and we exhort all
Christians to be so minded, and so to hold, adding
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nothing and taking away nothing. I, Heraclius, the
faithful emperor in Jesus Christ our Lord, have
subscribed.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sergius did not fail to have the Ecthesis confirmed by
a council at Constantinople. He died himself in
December, 638, but before this he had it read, probably,
to his Resident Council, and asked for the judgment of
its members. The bishops answered, like good courtiers,
<span class="tei tei-q">“The exposition of our great and most wise Emperor
agrees in truth with the teaching of the Apostles. This
is the doctrine of the Fathers, this the support of the
Church. This the confessions of the Five Councils
teach; by this the unity of the Christian people is assured,
the weakness of the simple strengthened. This works
the salvation of mankind. This we also believe; this
we confirm; with this we agree.”</span> Sergius gave his
solemn confirmation, and added, <span class="tei tei-q">“If any one henceforth,
disregarding the prohibition of the Emperor and the
Council, dares to teach that there is One Operation or
that there are Two in Christ he shall, if he be bishop,
priest, deacon, or clerk, be deposed; but if monk or layman,
be excluded from Communion in the Body and
Blood of our Lord until he return to his duty”</span>. Thereupon
the Ecthesis was attached publicly to the narthex
of Sancta Sophia.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Ecthesis had been specially drawn up against the
teaching of the champion of orthodoxy in the East,
Sophronius, patriarch of Jerusalem, who had appealed to
Pope Honorius, and expressed full trust in his defence of
the truth. But before its appearance Sophronius was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
already dead, and his see had come into the hands of the
Monothelite Sergius, Bishop of Joppa. Macedonius had,
contrary to the canons, been imposed on the see of
Antioch, and consecrated by Sergius of Constantinople.
It is true he had never entered his city, which was
already captured by the Arabs. He had remained in
Constantinople.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Cyrus, patriarch of Alexandria, in an epistle read
afterwards at the Roman Council of Pope St. Martin,
expressed to his spiritual brother and fellow-ministrant,
Sergius of Constantinople, his intense delight at the
Ecthesis which his great sovereign had drawn up in behalf
of the faith, which was ready to be sent to the exarch
Isaac at Ravenna, and was to be accepted by his brother
Severinus, elected at Rome. I have read it, he said, not
once or twice but many times. I admire an exposition
brilliant as the sun's light, announcing with unswerving
accuracy the true faith; and I sung praises to God who
had bestowed on us so wise a governor, guiding to
harbour the holy churches. He has saved us once, twice,
and thrice from tyrannous power, from Persian boastfulness,
from Saracen domination.<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the meantime Sergius had died, and Heraclius had
put his friend Pyrrhus, who shared his Monothelite
heresy, in his place at Constantinople. We learn from
the letter just quoted that the death of Pope Honorius
and the choice of Severinus to succeed him had already
been made known at Constantinople before the Ecthesis
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was sent to Rome,<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a>
which was, therefore, never presented
for acceptance to Honorius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I will now take another narrative<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a> of what was happening
at Rome. Honorius died on 12th October, 638, and
was buried in peace and great renown at St. Peter's.
The Romans chose their countryman Severinus, son of
Labienus, for his successor. The confirmation was
delayed during nineteen months and sixteen days, as
it seems, because the elected refused to subscribe the
Ecthesis of the patriarch Sergius, being a formulary
favouring Monothelism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Before Severinus was yet consecrated the imperial
officers practised a robbery upon the treasury of the
Church, in which the violence exercised reminds of the
dealing of Turkish pashas, with whom in general
Byzantine ministers may be compared. The treasures of
the Roman Church were kept in the vestiary of the
episcopal palace.<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href="#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> There were the costly presents which
various Christian emperors, patricians, and consuls had
left to the blessed Apostle Peter for the redemption of
their souls, to be given, as occasion might be, in alms to
the poor or for ransoming of captives. There was a
report that Honorius had stored up vast sums, and his
magnificent buildings caused full credence to be given to
this report. Isaac, the exarch in Ravenna, found himself
in want of money. The imperial troops riotously
demanded to be paid. Isaac had long cast his eyes on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Church's treasury, and now devised a plan to get
possession of it. The Book of the Popes gives a detailed
description of this incident, and it is not only an exception
to the scantiness of historical accounts about Rome,
but casts a passing light on the circumstances of the
city.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The chartular Mauritius was then at Rome, perhaps as
Magister Militum and commander of the Roman army.
This consisted of troops in Byzantine pay, but no doubt
was already organised as a city militia. Mauritius led
by deceit against the Church of God, and taking counsel
with certain ill-minded persons, stirred up this Roman
force. What good, he said, is it that such a mass of
money has been laid up by Pope Honorius in his
Lateran Palace while your wages are not paid, which our
lord the emperor has sent, and the holy man has put
them in his treasury? Kindled by these words, all the
armed men in the city of Rome, young and old, flocked
to the Lateran Palace. They could not force an entrance,
because those who attended on Severinus, the Pope elect,
resisted. Mauritius, seeing this, encamped his army
there for three days. Then he summoned the judges,
that is, the high officers of the city, who were in his
counsel. They broke in and set the imperial seal upon the
treasure. Then Mauritius wrote an account of what he
had done to the exarch Isaac at Ravenna, saying that he
had put his seal on the treasury and they could take
without harm anything which they liked. When Isaac
learnt this he came to Rome; he banished all the chief
persons of the church who resided in the several cities,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
so that none of the clergy could resist him, and, after
some days, he entered the Lateran Palace; he stayed
there eight days, and plundered everything. Part he
sent to the emperor in the imperial city, part he gave
to the troops, part he kept for himself. Anastasius concludes
with the words: After this the most holy
Severinus was consecrated, and Isaac returned to Ravenna.
The meaning of which seems to be that Isaac had come
to Rome under pretence of confirming the election of
Severinus, which he made the elected Pope pay for by
the plunder of his treasury.<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href="#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the meantime Roman Commissioners were urging
upon the emperor Heraclius at Constantinople to issue
the imperial consent to the consecration of the Pope.
After many negotiations, the chief of the clergy there
showed them a doctrinal writing, the Ecthesis, and said,
<span class="tei tei-q">“We will only support you in your matter if you
promise us to persuade the Pope to subscribe this act
and to recognise without reserve the doctrines therein
contained”</span>. The Commissioners, who perceived the
drift of the act, and that on account of this the first
See of Christendom had so long remained unfilled,
answered calmly and prudently: <span class="tei tei-q">“In this affair we can
do nothing. A message has been entrusted to us, but
no order given us to make a confession of faith. We
will give you the assurance that we will inform the
Elect of everything that you have said; that we will
show him this paper and beseech him, if he approve of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
its contents, to subscribe it. Be so good, therefore, as
to put no hindrance to our mission for this matter, to do
us no violence, and not to detain us without end.
None can do violence to another, especially in a matter
of faith; for in such a case even the weakest becomes
very strong, even the quietest feels himself a hero; and
since he strengthens his soul with the word of God, the
most violent attacks serve only to confirm not to weaken
him. And how much more does this apply to the
Church and clergy of Rome, who, from the beginning
to the present, as eldest of all the churches under the
sun, presides over all! Having received this privilege
according to the canons, as well from councils and
apostles as from their supreme Head, in this matter of
succession in the Pontificate, it is subject to no writings
whatsoever, to no issue of synodical documents; but
in all these matters all are subject to it according to
sacerdotal law.”</span> This is what with a most sacred and
becoming confidence, fearing nothing, those intrepid
ministers<a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a> of the immovable Rock said to the clergy of
Constantinople; who thereupon ceased from their pretension,
and promised to obtain for them the imperial
confirmation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pope Severinus, after suffering the double humiliation
of having the treasury of the Church sacked by the
emperor's viceroy, and his own election unconfirmed for
nearly twenty months, ascended the throne of Peter on
the 28th May, 640, and sat two months and six days.
<span class="tei tei-q">“He loved the clergy, and was most liberal to them all,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
says of him the Book of the Popes; <span class="tei tei-q">“holy, benignant
above all men, a lover of the poor, large-handed, most
gentle.”</span> In this short Pontificate he found time to
reject the imperial decree, called the Ecthesis.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Had Pope Severinus at this moment failed in his duty,
the whole Church would have been involved in the
Monothelite heresy. Not only Pope Severinus, but his
successors during forty years, were the sole stay of the
Church against a heresy—the last root of the condemned
Eutychean heresy—which overthrew the true doctrine
of the Incarnation, making our Lord Jesus Christ not
God and Man in one Person, but a Person compounded
out of God and Man, and therefore not Man at all.
The whole temporal power of the Byzantine sovereign,
at that time despotic lord of Rome, and backed by
subservient patriarchs, Sergius, Pyrrhus, Paulus, and
Peter, was exerted to compel the Popes who sat during
these forty years to accept the false doctrine presented
to them in an imperial decree.<a id="noteref_21" name="noteref_21" href="#note_21"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a> The successive Popes
in this time, Severinus, John IV., Theodore I., St.
Martin I., St. Eugenius I., St. Vitalian, Deusdedit,
Donus I., rejected and condemned the decision urged
upon them by the imperial and patriarchal pressure,
all of them at the risk of every sort of persecution—one,
St. Martin, at the cost of a singularly painful and
glorious martyrdom. The next Pope, St. Agatho,
condemned the heresy in a General Council allowed at
Constantinople itself by an orthodox emperor over
which his legates presided. The Pope succeeding him,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
St. Leo II. ratified the condemnation by the Council of
four successive Byzantine patriarchs, Sergius, Pyrrhus,
Paulus and Peter, as heretics, and censured the negligence
of Honorius in not extinguishing at once so
dangerous a flame. In truth it had held the life of the
Church in suspense during more than forty years. Had
one of the ten successors of Honorius failed, all would
have been lost, so near to the precipice was the
Byzantine despotism and the State patriarchate, subservient
to it, and supplying it obediently with theological
knowledge sufficient to formulate heresy, allowed
by the Divine Providence in that fearful century to
drive the Church. And precisely during these years
the new Arabian conqueror—the chalif of Mohammed—cut
in two the empire which was attempting this
parricide. When Heraclius went forth committing his
city and his son to God, to the holy Mother of God, and
to his bishop, he triumphed for the only time in the
long Roman history over Rome's eastern rival, and
brought back the Cross from Persia to Constantinople,
and then carried it in dutiful homage to be replaced in
its old shrine where our Lord suffered at Jerusalem.
When at the bidding of that very bishop Sergius he
tampered with the Christian faith, and oppressed the
successor of St. Peter, he lost Jerusalem, Alexandria,
and Antioch, with the great provinces which belonged
to them. Out of the four patriarchates of his empire,
three became subject to the Mohammedan chalif. The
subjection came suddenly, but has lasted with a short
interval from that time to this. The conquest, as yet
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
unbroken, of Mohammed over Christian peoples dates
from the perfidy of Heraclius and of his grandson
Constans II. and the heresy propagated by four Byzantine
patriarchs.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Returning to the history of this time we find that the
successor of Pope Severinus, John IV., was consecrated
24th December, 640, and held a council at Rome immediately
after his accession, and condemned under anathema
the Monothelite heresy. Heraclius died February 11th,
641. Upon his death Pope John IV. sent a letter to
his successors, Constantinus-Heraclius, and Heracleonas,
setting forth the same faith. He also informed the
new Patriarch, Pyrrhus, that he had condemned the
Ecthesis: and St. Maximus informs us that Heraclius I.,
to turn away the Western displeasure at the Ecthesis
from his own person, at the beginning of the year 641
wrote to Pope John IV. that <span class="tei tei-q">“the Ecthesis is not mine,
nor did I command it to be drawn up, but the patriarch
Sergius prepared it five years ago, and besought me on
my return from the East to publish it with my subscription”</span>.
The purpose of John IV. in writing to the new
emperors was to set forth the doctrine of the two Operations
and Wills in Christ, and in doing this to defend the
orthodoxy of his predecessor Honorius. It is to be
observed that after the death of Honorius, when the
eastern patriarchs began to assert that Honorius in his
answers to Sergius, which up to that time had been
private, favoured the heresy which Sergius had imposed
upon the eastern bishops, and was trying to put upon
the Pope, his successors denied with much care that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Honorius had any such meaning. Thus in this document
of Pope John IV. directed to the sons of Heraclius, which
bears the title,<a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href="#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a> Defence of Pope Honorius, he says:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“My predecessor, teaching concerning the mystery of
Christ's Incarnation, said that there were not in Him, as
there are in us, opposing wills of the spirit and the
flesh. Certain men, twisting this to their own meaning,
threw out the suspicion that he had taught that there
was one Will of the Godhead and the Manhood, which is
utterly contrary to the truth. I could wish them to
reply to my question, in regard to which nature do they
assert that there is one Will of Christ our God? If it be
only in regard to the Divine Nature, what is their reply
concerning His Human Nature? For he is likewise Perfect
Man, lest they be condemned with Manichæus. If they
speak in regard to the Manhood of Christ that this Will
is Perfect God, let them see whether they do not fall
under the condemnation of Photinus and Ebion. But if
they assert that in the Two Natures there is only one
Will, they will confuse not only the Natural Wills but
the Natures themselves, so that neither the one nor the
other, that is, the Divine and the Human, can be understood.
For as we do not, like the impious Nestorius,
suffer Two Natures to make up one Christ, so we do anything
but deny, yet neither do we confuse, the difference
of Natures, inasmuch as we confess the Two Natures
united in the one Person of Christ our God with an
agreement which language is not able to express. For
in that they assert One Will of Christ's Godhead and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Manhood and at the same time one Operation, what else
do they assert than that one Nature of Christ our God
operates according to the division of Eutyches and
Severus. As a last argument, the orthodox Fathers,
who have flourished in the whole world, are proved to
teach in full accordance at once Two Natures and Two
Wills and Operations.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In these words, which John IV. writes as Pope to the
immediate successors of Heraclius within three years
after the death of Honorius, he would seem not only to
have set forth in plain language the immense importance
of the doctrine itself, but to be an unimpeachable
witness of the meaning of Honorius, one of whose priests
he had been, and as such well acquainted with his
doctrine.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The pontificate of John IV., for the confirmation of
which he had to wait four months, lasted only twenty-one
months, and was disquieted throughout by the conflict
with the Byzantine court and patriarch respecting
the Ecthesis.<a id="noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a>
There was war between the exarch and
the Lombard king, Rotharis, but it did not touch
Rome. All misfortunes which threatened it came from
Byzantium. The struggle against the eastern heresy
embittered the feeling of Constantinople to Rome. At
the same time, the Byzantine court was disturbed by
intestine revolutions. Heraclius ended his reign of 31
years in February, 641. His eldest son, Heraclius
Constantinus, succeeded, but, after seven months, was
poisoned by his stepmother, Martina, and the Monothelite
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
patriarch Pyrrhus was charged with concurrence.
In a few months, Martina's own son, Heracleonas, was
deposed by an insurrection. His nose was cut off, and
the tongue of the empress Martina cut out, and both
were banished. The grandson of Heraclius, Constans
II., became emperor in 642, a boy of twelve years, and
reigned 26 years, until 668. The reign of this emperor
is much to be noted, because it is contemporaneous with
the second, third, and fourth chalifs: Constans II.
stands in history over against Omar, Osman, and Ali.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the death of John IV., Theodorus, a Greek of
Jerusalem, was made Pope: it is supposed by the influence
of the exarch Isaac. He was the first of many
Greeks, who, in this period, were made Popes: of all
of whom, without exception, it is recorded that their
integrity, as Popes, was in no way affected by any
national feeling: they sacrificed nothing to Byzantine
policy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the beginning of this pontificate, Mauritius, the
officer called chartular, whose proceeding in the robbery
of the Lateran treasury has been recorded above, raised
a rebellion in Rome. He found people, nobility, and
army embittered by the Byzantine domination, and
used this feeling for his own purposes. He spread a
report that Isaac was striving to be king, made party
with those same turbulent Romans who had joined in
the attack upon the Lateran, and induced the garrisons
in all the castles of the Roman territory to refuse obedience
to the exarch. When Isaac heard this, that all
the army of Italy had taken the oath to Mauritius, he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sent Donus as commander with an army to Rome.
Thereupon the Roman army gave up Mauritius, and
joined Donus. Mauritius took asylum at St. Mary of
the Crib.<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href="#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a>
He was taken out and sent with an iron
collar about his neck, as well as the others implicated
in the insurrection, to the exarch at Ravenna: but, before
he arrived there, was beheaded, and his head carried
to Ravenna and impaled. Isaac kept the other conspirators
in prison, collared in the same way, but they
escaped execution by the death of Isaac himself. Isaac
was buried in the beautiful church of St. Vitale, in Ravenna,
and his epitaph is preserved in Greek, and being
a picture not only of the man, but of his time, is worth
transcribing. It runs thus:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Here lies one, a brilliant commander, who for six
years, preserved Rome and the West without injury
for our serene lords, Isaac, the fellow-worker with emperors,
the great ornament of all Armenia, where he
was of illustrious race. Upon his death in great renown,
his wife Susannah mourns over her loss like a
chaste dove, the loss of a husband who gained glory
by his labours both in the East and in the West, for
he commanded the army of both.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Isaac may be considered as the ideal exarch, and by
contemplating his deeds, we may attain to a knowledge
of the race of exarchs, viceroys of Italy, and images, in
common clay, of their masters in marble, towards whom,
for 200 years, St. Gregory and his successors had to
exercise the virtue of loyalty.

Upon the accession of Constans II., in 642, the
patriarch Pyrrhus, under suspicion of complicity with
the empress Martina in the poisoning of the emperor
Heraclius Constantinus, fled to Africa. His place was
taken by Paulus, a still more zealous Monothelite.
Pyrrhus, coming to the West, which was unanimous in
rejecting that heresy, represented himself to have been
convinced by the eloquence of the Abbot Maximus, in
an African Council in 645, and came to Rome to lay
the confession of his faith at the feet of the Apostle
Peter. Pope Theodorus received the repentant patriarch
with great ceremony in the Vatican Basilica
before the assembled clergy and people, to whom
he solemnly condemned his own errors. But, when
he went to Ravenna, Pyrrhus fell back again. Pope
Theodorus thereupon condemned him in a Roman
Council.<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href="#note_25"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In 646, the African bishops, in four councils, had
condemned the Monothelite doctrine with the Ecthesis.
Pope Theodorus, in accordance with the wish of these
African Councils, admonished the new patriarch, Paulus
II., at Constantinople, to return to the faith of the
Church. Paulus sent a long answer,<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href="#note_26"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a> in which he expressed
the Monothelite doctrine. Pope Theodorus
condemned him after his nuncios at Constantinople
had in vain endeavoured to draw from him an orthodox
confession. At the same time Pope Theodorus
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
named Stephen, Bishop of Dor, Apostolic Vicar for
Palestine, with the charge to resist the heresy which
Sergius, Bishop of Joppa, was spreading, and to depose
the bishops intruded by him. The patriarchal chair at
Jerusalem was, in fact, vacant, and the patriarchate laid
waste by this usurper. Hence the Pope took charge of
it. So afterwards John of Philadelphia was appointed
Apostolic Vicar.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Paulus did not give way. He moved the emperor
Constans II. in 648 to issue a new doctrinal decree,
drawn up by himself, called the Typus, which was to
take the place of the Ecthesis, and prepare in another
way the spread of Monothelite error. It was to forbid
under the severest secular punishments any dispute
respecting One or Two Operations in our Lord or
One or Two Wills. In itself it seemed intended to
quiet the westerns, but in the actual state of things
only for the prejudice of Catholics. Maximus the Confessor
shewed that in it truth and error were alike intended
to be suppressed. The eastern bishops were
again compelled to subscribe. Those who refused
were persecuted, even the papal legates. Their altar
in the Placidia palace was destroyed, and they
were forbidden to celebrate, and severe ill-treatment
added.

In the mean time Pope Theodorus, having during the
seven years of his pontificate maintained the faith
against the aggression of the Byzantine emperor and
patriarch with the same resolution as his predecessors,
Popes Severinus and John IV., died on the 13th May,
649, and was buried at St. Peter's. His death occurred
just after the Typus had been issued, and perhaps before
he had seen it. On the 5th of the following July,
Martin was chosen to succeed him.<a id="noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a> Martin was then a
Roman priest, had been a nuncio at Constantinople, a
man distinguished by his virtue and knowledge, as well
as by his personal beauty. By the fifteenth letter of
this Pope we learn that the Roman clergy would not
wait for the imperial consent to his consecration, and so
in due time the Greeks pretended that he had taken
possession of the episcopate irregularly. This pontiff,
one of the most remarkable and vigorous that ever sat
on the throne of St. Peter, although aware of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
penalty imposed by the emperor Constans, in his Typus,
shrunk not the least, but was rather kindled with
greater zeal to summon immediately a council of the
Bishops of Italy, which met on the 5th October in this
year at the Sacristy of the Lateran Basilica.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Anastasius,<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href="#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a>
the librarian, gives the following narrative
of events which now took place concerning Pope
Martin:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“In his time Paulus, bishop of Constantinople,
inflated with the Spirit of pride against the holy Church
of God, presumed in his audacity to go against the
definitions of the Fathers. Moreover he took pains to
veil his own error for the seduction of others, so that
he induced the emperor also to set forth the Typus for
the destruction of Catholic belief. In this he deprived
of their strength all the voices of the holy Fathers by
the expressions of the worst heretics, laying down that
one should confess neither One nor Two Wills or
Operations in Christ our Lord.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“In defending his own perversion he did a deed which
no former heretic had ventured to do. He pulled down
the altar belonging to our Holy See<a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a> in the chapel of the
Placidia palace, prohibiting our nuncios from offering
therein to God the adorable and immaculate Victim, or
receiving the sacraments of communion. These nuncios
by command of the apostolic authority had enjoined
him to desist from his heretical intention. They also
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
bore witness in suffering diverse persecutions with other
orthodox men, and venerable priests, some of whom he
imprisoned, some he banished, some he scourged. Well
nigh the whole world being thus disturbed, many of the
orthodox brought up complaints from various places to
our Apostolic See, intreating that the web of all this
malice and destruction might be rent by the Apostolic
authority, so that the disease of their Ecthesis might
not break up the whole body of the Catholic Church.
Then most blessed Martin, the bishop, sent and assembled
105 bishops in the city of Rome, and called a
Synod according to the institution of the orthodox
Fathers in the church of the Saviour at the Lateran
episcopal palace. Bishops and priests sitting, deacons
and the whole clergy standing, they condemned Cyrus
of Alexandria, Sergius, Pyrrhus, and Paulus, patriarchs
of Constantinople, who presumed to mix up their
innovations with the immaculate faith. That is, in
their haste to exclude this, they dressed up a confusion
of heretical dogmas against God's Catholic church, for
which they were smitten with anathema. This council
now forms part of the Church's archives. And the
Pope causing copies to be made, sent them throughout
the East and West, placing them in the hands of the
orthodox faithful. At that very time the emperor sent
into Italy his chamberlain and exarch Olympius, to be
viceroy of the whole land. His commands were:—<span class="tei tei-q">‘You
are to carry out what Paulus, patriarch of this heaven
defended city, has suggested to us. And if you find the
province itself agreeing in the Typus set forth by us
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
then lay hold of all the bishops, landed proprietors,
dwellers, and strangers, and let them subscribe it. But,
if, as Plato, the patrician, and Euphranius have
suggested to us, you can carry with you the armed
force there, we command you to lay hold of Martin,
who was nuncio here, in the imperial city. And afterwards
let all the churches read afresh the orthodox
Typus, because it has been made by us, and let all the
bishops in Italy set their names to it. But if you find
the armed force opposed, keep it secret till you have got
possession of the province, and are able to have on
your side the army of the Roman city, and of Ravenna,
that you may be able to execute our commands as soon
as possible.’</span> The said Olympius, coming to Rome,
found the holy Church of Rome united with all the
bishops of Italy, whether priests or clergy, and wishing
to execute the commands received he tried, by help of
the army, to make a schism in the Church. This took
a long time, and Almighty God did not permit him to
accomplish what he was trying to do. Seeing then
that he was overcome by the holy Catholic and Apostolic
Church of God, he thought it necessary to veil his bad
intention, and to accomplish what he had not been able
to do with the armed hand in heretical fashion at mass
in the Church of God's Holy Mother, the Ever-virgin
Mary, at the Crib. For while the holy Pope was giving
him communion he had instructed one of his guards to
murder him. But, Almighty God, who is wont to
protect His orthodox servants, and to deliver them from
all evil, Himself blinded the eyes of the swordsman of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the exarch Olympius, and he was not allowed to see the
Pontiff at the moment of giving communion, or the
kiss of peace, that he might shed his blood and subject
to heresy the Catholic Church of God. The soldier
attested this afterwards on his oath to several. So
Olympius, seeing that the hand of God protected the
holy Pope Martin, thought it necessary to agree with
him, and to disclose the commands which he had
received. Then having made peace with the Church,
he collected his army and went to Sicily against the
Saracens who were there. And through the sin a great
destruction fell on the Roman army, and then the
exarch died of disease.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the Council of the Lateran, held by Pope Martin
in 649, the Pope carefully examined the whole history
and documents concerning the attempt of the patriarch
Sergius, and the emperor Heraclius, and the succeeding
patriarchs at Alexandria, Constantinople, and Antioch,
to alter the faith of the Church. The imperial documents,
the Ecthesis of Heraclius, composed by Sergius,
the Typus of Constans II. composed by the sitting
patriarch, Paulus, both of them one after the other
imposed by violence on the eastern episcopate, letters
from many bishops, documents, in fact, of every kind,
were subjected to careful reading. The Council drew up
twenty canons which it imposed under anathema. The
Pope at the head of the Bishops, subscribed in these
words: <span class="tei tei-q">“I, Martin, by the grace of God, Bishop of the
holy Catholic and Apostolic Church of the City of
Rome, ordain and subscribe this definition, confirmatory
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the orthodox faith, and condemning Sergius, formerly
Bishop of Constantinople, Cyrus, Bishop of Alexandria,
Theodorus, Bishop, Pyrrhus, and Paulus, also, Bishop of
Constantinople, together with their heretical writings”</span>.
Then follow the signatures of the Bishops of Italy, the
Archbishop of Aquileia and Grado first, the Archbishop
of Milan adding his assent afterwards.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pope Martin also wrote to the emperor Constans II.,
sending him the acts of the Council, together with a
Greek translation. Thus, with the utmost force, and
with the presentiment of hard trials, he strove to
prevent the further spread of Monothelite error. He
also declared himself against the heretical patriarchs,
Peter of Alexandria and Macedonius of Antioch,
deposed Paul, Archbishop of Thessalonica, and provided
for sending Catholic bishops and clergy to the
East.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In these events, we have this very striking fact, that
within eleven years after the death of Pope Honorius
in 638, we find four Popes his immediate successors,
Severinus, John IV., Theodorus, and Martin, opposing
two emperors, Heraclius, and his grandson, Constans II.,
censuring three patriarchs of Constantinople, Sergius,
Pyrrhus, and Paulus, besides other eastern patriarchs,
and the last of them solemnly condemning <span class="tei tei-q">“the impious
Ecthesis and still more impious Typus,”</span> and all manner
of heretical expositions, whether made by patriarchs, or
imposed by emperors. There can be no doubt that all
these four Popes had been clergy of Honorius himself,
and as little doubt that they were maintaining the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
doctrine which he held. There is no appearance that
any one at Rome was the least inclined to the Monothelite
heresy, and the insidious manner in which it was
propagated by those who held it is conspicuous on every
occasion. Nor must it be forgotten that the publication
of this judgment of Pope Martin fulfils all the conditions
of a judgment <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ex cathedra</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the events which now took place are of so great
an importance for all subsequent time that it seems
necessary to enlarge upon the epitome of them just
given, and to draw out the full range of their bearing,
not only on the doctrine of the Church, but on its
government at the time.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We are witnessing a deliberate attempt by successive
patriarchs of Constantinople to alter the faith of the
Church as it had been laid down at the Council of
Chalcedon. And not this only, but to make the mouth
of their emperor the instrument for disseminating their
heresy, and to use the whole material power of that
emperor as despotic lord of Rome to overthrow the
defence of the faith by the Roman See, the superior
authority of which, at the same time, neither emperor
nor patriarch denied. This attempt continues during
forty years from the death of Pope Honorius in 638,
and in the whole of that time, it was the constancy of the
Roman See, the purely spiritual power of the successor
of St. Peter, in the midst of the greatest danger and a
helpless temporal position, which preserved the life of
the Church, and foiled the Byzantine oppressor, together
with the underplay of the Byzantine patriarch.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I take from the Acts of the Lateran Council of 649
the following:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Pope Martin said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Let the copy of the Typus lately
composed against the orthodox faith, by persuasion of
Paul, Bishop of Constantinople, be brought before our
consideration’</span>.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Theophylact, first of the notaries of the Apostolic
See, said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I bear in my hands the copy of the Typus
ordered by your Beatitude’</span>.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Pope Martin said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Let it be read in the presence of
the holy Council, that we may accurately examine its
meaning’</span>.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Theodoras, regionary notary of the Apostolic See,
read it thus, translated from the Greek into Latin.”</span> It
must be remembered that the following are words of the
emperor, spoken in that character.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Since we are accustomed to do everything and to
consider everything which concerns our Christian
polity, and especially whatever touches the purity of
our faith, through which we look for all our prosperity,
we recognise how greatly our orthodox people has been
disturbed. Some of them maintain One Will in the
dispensation of our great God and Saviour, Jesus Christ,
and His One Operation in divine and human things.
Others maintain Two Wills and Two Operations in the
same dispensation of the Incarnate Word. The one
support themselves by saying that our Lord Jesus
Christ, because of the One Person, wills and operates
both divine and human things in the two natures,
without confusion, and without separation. The others
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
say, because in one and the same Person two natures
are bound together without division, their distinction
from each other remains, and according to the quality
of the natures one and the same Christ operates both
what is divine and what is human. Hence our Christian
polity has been led into much variance and strife; the
parties do not agree, and thus it is injured in many
ways. Led therefore by Almighty God, we thought it
fit to quench the flame of dissension thus enkindled, and
not allow it further to feed upon human souls. We
therefore proclaim to our subjects, who continue in
orthodoxy, and the immaculate Christian faith, and
belong to the Catholic and Apostolic Church, that it is
no longer open to them to introduce any question,
strife, or contention with each other concerning One
Will or One Operation, or Two Operations or Two Wills.
This we command, not as taking anything away from
the pious belief of the holy approved Fathers concerning
the dispensation of our Incarnate God the Word, but
intending to put a stop to further contest on account of
the said questions, and in these to follow and be satisfied
with the sacred Scriptures and the traditions of the
five holy Ecumenical Councils, and the simple unquestioned
usages and expressions of the holy approved
Fathers. Their dogmas, canons, and laws are those of
the holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. Add to them
nothing of your own: take from them nothing: interpret
them not according to your own view, but
keep the form which existed everywhere before the
contention upon these questions arose. None then laid
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
down One Will or One Operation, or Two Wills or Two
Operations, under any contention.... Now to ensure
perfect unity and concord, and to leave no opportunity
to those who would contend for ever, we have ordered
the documents (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the Ecthesis) attached to the
narthex of the great church in our imperial city, which
contain the questions above mentioned, to be removed.
Now those who transgress these commands will first
be subject to the judgment of Almighty God, and then
to the severe imperial indignation for contempt. If it
be a bishop or clerk, he shall be deposed from his particular
rank; if a monk, he shall be banished; if noble
or military, he shall be deposed. If they be private
persons, when of rank, their property shall be confiscated;
when of low degree, they shall be scourged and
banished for ever. So that all shall be restrained by
the fear of God, and seeing the punishments respectively
threatened, shall maintain unshaken and undisturbed,
the peace of God's holy Churches.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a> one Bishop of Constantinople, Sergius, composed
the Ecthesis, so another, his second successor, Paul,
composed the Typus, but as Sergius did not give to his
work the fitting form of an imperial decree, but the
theological form of a creed, Paul showed himself more
skilful, and dressed his Typus in imperial clothing.
Constans himself says that he meant to restore the
peace of the Church by this new decree. There is no
reason to doubt this, since, in tearing down the Ecthesis
from the wall of Sancta Sophia, he plainly purposed to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
quiet the minds of the Westerns and those who held
with them. It is further clear that while the Ecthesis
forbade contention concerning One or Two Operations, it
inconsistently proclaimed One Will, that is Monothelism.
But the Typus consistently rejected not only One Operation,
but One Will. It wished in this to be impartial.
This apparent impartiality is likewise the chief distinction
between the Typus and the Ecthesis, for they are
like each other in the main thought, which is, that the
development of doctrine should remain at the point
to which it had come in the five general councils, and
that further questions should not be entered into.
However, that impartiality is but a false
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">via media</span></span>, for
it puts the true doctrine of the Two Wills upon the
same footing with the heresy, and forbids both one and
the other. Another distinction between the Ecthesis
and the Typus lies in this, that the Ecthesis only
required obedience in general. Constans, on the contrary,
threatened every transgressor of his Typus with
the severest civil punishments, and these he executed
with the utmost cruelty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Typus is the fifth specimen of doctrinal despotism
proceeding from the Byzantine emperors since the time
of St. Leo. In all these the effort was the same. So
far as the relation between the emperor and the Pope
is concerned, the principle at issue is whether the
Byzantine emperor, with the Byzantine patriarch as
his chief agent, should dictate the creed and direct the
government of the Church, or the Pope and the bishops.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first attempt proceeds from Basiliscus, who, by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
insurrection got possession of the imperial throne for
about twenty months, and in that short time issued the
Encyclikon, in which Timotheus Ailouros, patriarch of
Alexandria, helped him as to the composition, and 500
Greek bishops were found to accept and praise it.
Basiliscus with his wife and children, was presently
starved to death by the emperor Zeno.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second attempt was by Zeno, when he had
recovered the throne, and fallen into the hands of
his patriarch Acacius. He then issued the Henoticon,
which Acacius had drawn up, which was imposed by
force on the bishops, and which Fravita, Euphemius,
Macedonius, and Timotheus, successive patriarchs of
Constantinople, submitted to subscribe, the first under
Zeno, the following three under Anastasius. The wisdom
and firmness of successive Popes frustrated this attempt,
and Hormisdas finally obtained a full reparation, and
the acknowledgment of his own charge over the whole
Church, by the gift of Christ to St. Peter, which the
bishops of the Apostolic See inherited.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet, notwithstanding this most solemn confession on
the part of the bishop of Constantinople, of the
emperor, and of the nobles of the East, some thirty
years later, Justinian, having become direct lord of
Rome, and having summoned Pope Vigilius as his
temporal subject, to go to Constantinople, makes a third
attempt, and issues to the Fifth General Council his
own <span class="tei tei-q">“Confession of Faith,”</span> which a recreant court-archbishop,
Theodore Askidas, supplies him with, and
which the patriarch of Constantinople, Eutychius, then,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by the emperor's nomination, presiding over the Council,
as well as the eastern bishops in the Council, receive.
The whole attitude and conduct of Justinian at the Fifth
Council show how deeply this most distinguished of the
eastern emperors was imbued with the doctrinal
despotism of his throne. And from that time, the
contention of his successors is still more pronounced,
and their temporal power over the Pope, as their
subject, is unsparingly exercised, not to deny his
spiritual supremacy in itself, but to make its exercise
subject to their imperial power, and in this the patriarchs
of Constantinople, assuming by and with the consent
of the emperors, the title of Ecumenical Patriarch,
serve their sovereign as the chief instrument for
reducing the Church to servitude. It is to be observed
that Justinian conferred this title upon them in his laws.
From that time they one and all clung to it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fourth attempt is made by Heraclius at the end
of his long reign, when he had fallen under the
influence of Sergius, as his predecessor, Zeno, had fallen
under the influence of Acacius. Not only did Sergius
hold the great see of the capital during twenty-eight
years from 610 to 638, but things recorded of him seem
to indicate that he was a man of extraordinary resolution.
He had preserved Heraclius from deserting his
capital, and flying back for refuge to his father at
Carthage, after a long series of defeats from the
Persians. He had acted as guardian of his son, and
administrator of the empire during the marvellous six
years when Heraclius, shaking off twelve years of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
apathy, and going forth in the name of God, and in
publicly uttered commendation of his kingdom to the
Blessed Mother of God, had triumphed over the Great
King. Servius finally supplied him with the exposition,
which was to present in seeming concord the wrangling
episcopacy of his eastern empire, and overcome the
Roman Pontiff in his maintenance of the faith.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fifth attempt was made by Constans II., grandson
of Heraclius, for whom Paul II., patriarch of Constantinople,
invested his heresy in fitting language, and
presented it in the Typus as an imperial decree which
all were to accept under punishment to property, freedom,
or life. And Pope Martin I. had to fight the old
battle of the Church as a subject to a sovereign who
was at once without mercy and without scruple.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Typus is the perfect specimen of the theologising
emperor, who begins by attributing to himself the
charge over the whole Church, and puts himself
precisely in the place of the Pope and the bishops in
formulating the true Christian doctrine, wherein he
claims the initiative, and the ultimate decision.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It need only be added that in all this succession of
attempts to deprive the Church of God of her liberty,
and the Pope of that guardianship of the faith which
alone is adequate to its maintenance, the successors of
Constantine departed essentially from the position which
the first of Christian emperors took at the first General
Council. He did not sit in that Council. He placed
himself with the sword of empire at the entrance to
guard the approach. He made the decrees of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Council laws of the Roman empire; but he acknowledged
that the power to make them rested in the
bishops alone.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nor would it be unhistorical to note that in proportion
as the emperors, whose seat was Byzantium, encroached
upon the liberty of the Church, and sought domination
over the successor of St. Peter, in whose prerogatives
that liberty was seated, their temporal empire declined.
The despotism which flung itself with insolence and
violence against the Church became odious to its own
subjects. We shall see an instance of this which almost
passes belief when the patriarchate of St. Athanasius
embraces the Moslem conqueror, to escape the Byzantine
sovereign, and terms the defenders of the Christian
faith Melchites, that is, Royalists, because, while they
rejected the Eutychean heresy, they were likewise loyal
to the eastern emperor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us see how Pope Martin meets this attempt. No sooner is he invested
with <span class="tei tei-q">“the great mantle,”</span><a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href="#note_32"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a> than he
summons a Council to meet in the basilica of Constantine,
then called the Church of the Saviour, now St.
John Lateran, adjoining the papal palace, the Mother
Church of Rome. He called this council in order to
judge the doctrine which two emperors, using two
Byzantine patriarchs, and at the same time used by
them, seek to impose upon the Church, instead of the
doctrine of St. Leo the Great, accepted and set forth at
the Council of Chalcedon. It held from the 5th to the
31st October, 649, five sittings. It was attended by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
105 bishops, chiefly from Italy (excluding the Lombard
dominion), Sicily and Sardinia, with some African, and
a few foreign. The acts have come to us complete, both
in Greek and Latin, the former being the proper
language of the two documents, the Ecthesis and Typus.
I give the following epitome of the Pope's speech to the
Council:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Christ has commanded pastors to be watchful: this
concerns us also, and especially must we watch over
the purity of the faith, since certain bishops, who do
not deserve this name, have lately sought to spoil our
confession of belief by new invented expressions.
Everyone knows them, since they have come forward
openly to injure the Church: such are Cyrus of Alexandria,
Sergius of Constantinople, and his followers,
Pyrrhus and Paulus. Cyrus eighteen years ago taught
in Alexandria One Operation in Christ, and published
from the pulpit nine heads of doctrine. Sergius
approved this, issued somewhat later the Ecthesis under
the name of the emperor Heraclius, and taught One
Will and One Operation, which leads to One Nature of
Christ. The Fathers distinctly taught that Operation
answers to Nature, and whoever has like Operation
must likewise be of like Nature. Since then the Fathers
teach Two Natures in Christ, it follows that Two Wills
and Operations are united without mixture and without
division in one and the same Incarnate Word. That
both are naturally one thing is not possible. Pope Leo
also taught Two Wills, and so holy Scripture indicates.
So Christ wrought what belonged to the Godhead
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
corporeally, since He manifested it through His flesh
animated by a reasonable soul; but what belonged to
the Manhood, He wrought by the Godhead, since He
took upon Him freely for our sake human weaknesses,
that is, sufferings, but without sin. Cyrus, in issuing
his nine heads of doctrine, Sergius, in issuing the
Ecthesis, contradicted the doctrine of Leo, and of the
Council of Chalcedon. But Pyrrhus and Paulus spread
the error more widely; in particular, Pyrrhus by threats
and flatteries seduced many bishops to subscribe his
impiety. When he had afterwards come to shame, he
came hither and presented to our Holy See a writing in
which he anathematised his former error. But he
returned as a dog to his vomit, and was therefore
rightly deposed. But Paulus went even beyond his
predecessor; he confirmed the Ecthesis, and contradicted
the true doctrine.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Therefore he also was deposed by the Holy See.
Specially imitating Sergius, to cover his error he
counselled the emperor to issue the Typus, which annuls
the Catholic doctrine, denies to Christ properly all will
and all operation, and therewith likewise each nature,
for nature is shown by its operation. He has done what
hitherto no heretic has dared; he has destroyed the
altar of our Holy See in the Placidia Palace, and forbidden
our Nuncios to celebrate thereon. He has persecuted
those nuncios because they exhorted him to give
up his error, as well as other orthodox men, imprisoning
some, banishing others, beating others. As these men
(that is, Sergius and the rest) have disturbed well-nigh

the whole world, complaints both written and oral have
come to us from various sides urging us to put down the
falsehood by apostolic authority. Our predecessors have
both by writing and by their nuncios tried to correct
them, but without success. We have, therefore, thought
it needful to convoke you, to consider together with you
them and the new teaching.”</span><a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href="#note_33"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a>

Pope Theodorus had named Stephen, Bishop of Dor, in
Palestine, to be Apostolic Vicar in that province. He
was the prelate whom the patriarch of Jerusalem,
Sophronius, had sent to Rome in the time of Honorius to
solicit support for the faith of that Pope, and to set
before him the dangerous state of affairs. He was introduced
in the Lateran Council at its second sitting, and
read to it the following memorial:—<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a>

Martin presiding, in the great city of the elder Rome,
for the confirmation and defence of the definitions received
from our fathers and councils, I, Stephen, Bishop, and
sitting in the first see of the council under the throne of
Jerusalem, make the following report:—Jerusalem was
in peace and tranquillity when the tempest broke upon
it. For first of all Theodorus, Bishop of Pharan, then
Cyrus, Bishop of Alexandria, then Sergius, Bishop of
Constantinople, and Pyrrhus and Paulus, who succeeded
him, set up afresh the doctrine of the heretics Apollinaris
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Severus. By these men the whole Catholic
Church has been thrown into confusion. I speak to
your supreme see, which is set over all sees, for the healing
of every wound, for this it has been accustomed to do
with power from of old and from the beginning by
apostolical authority. Since Peter, the great head of the
Apostles, was manifestly invested not only with the keys
of heaven to open to those who believe and to close to
those who disbelieve the gospel, but he first had the
charge to feed the sheep of the whole Catholic Church—to
convert and confirm his spiritual brethren of the same
order, as he received this dignity over all, given to him
providentially by God Himself for our sakes incarnate.</span>

shalt answer to God Himself who on this spot chose to
be crucified for us, when He comes at His glorious
epiphany to judge the living and the dead, if thou
delayest and disregardest His endangered faith, for I
myself am bodily prevented from doing this by the
Saracen invasion which has come upon us for our sins.<a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href="#note_35"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a>

again make known to the holy men there what is being
here mooted, until with apostolic prudence they bring
forth judgment to victory, and effect, according to the
canons, a complete annulment of these innovating
doctrines. Shuddering at the adjuration put on me in
this most holy spot, remembering also the episcopal
dignity granted to me by God, further bearing in mind
the entreaties from almost all the bishops of the East and
their Christian people, agreeing with Sophronius, who is
now among the saints, as first of the Episcopal Council
of Jerusalem, I gave no sleep to my eyes nor slumber to
my eyelids in fulfilling this command. This now is the
third time that I take refuge at your apostolical feet,
beseeching you, as all beseech you, to help the faith of
Christians in its danger. The enemy pursue me from
place to place to have me imprisoned and delivered to
them in fetters, but the Lord has saved me from my persecutors.
Nor has God failed to the prayers of His
supplicants, but has raised up your predecessors, the
apostolic prelates, to no slight exertions in correcting
these men, though they would not be softened, and now
he has raised up the most blessed Pope Martin.... I
beseech you, therefore, not to despise the earnest
entreaties of the orthodox bishops and peoples throughout
the East, and of my now sainted lord Sophronius,

In further sittings of this Council abundant testimony
from the Greek and Latin fathers was presented to show
how contrary to them was the teaching which the emperors
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and the patriarchs of Byzantium were seeking by
crude force to impose on bishops and people. In the end
the Council passed twenty canons fully setting forth the
true doctrine, and condemning the heresy as contrary to
what had been taught up to that time: especially <span class="tei tei-q">“the
most impious Ecthesis which was made by Heraclius,

Martin under anathema upon matters of faith are as

The creed of this Council is a simple repetition

Among the documents read at the Lateran Council
was one from the whole African episcopate addressed to
Pope Theodorus three years before, in 646, in the following
titles: <span class="tei tei-q">“To our most blessed Lord, seated in the
apostolic headship, the Father of Fathers, Theodorus,
most holy Pope and Chief Shepherd of all Prelates,
Columbus Bishop of the first See of the Byzacene

Mauritanian Council, and with us all the bishops of
the three Councils of Africa.”</span> It is to be noted that the
Archbishop of Carthage is not mentioned, for Fortunatus
was elected somewhat later to take the place of
a Monothelite. <span class="tei tei-q">“No one can question that a great and
neverfailing spring of grace wells forth from your

by divine decree in a peculiar and unique
manner, to search into and to treat the sacred doctrines

it is the most necessary function of the high priest of

This letter has a double interest, being one of the last

the patriarchates which had fallen under Mohammedan
domination. He announces to them that, after due examination,
he had condemned <span class="tei tei-q">“the Exposition of the
Emperor Heraclius, and the formula of the present
serene emperor,”</span> and he deplores the havoc which
heretics had made in the East, irregularly setting up a
false bishop at Antioch, the heretic Macedonius, and
another, Peter, at Alexandria. The Pope adds that in
his anxiety to build up the Church of God, which they
were laying waste, he had, according to the power
given him by the Lord in the person of blessed Peter,
ordered his brother John, Bishop of Philadelphia, to
supply his place in all ecclesiastical matters through the
East, and to create in all cities episcopally subject to
the Sees of Antioch and Jerusalem bishops, priests, and
deacons, and he begs them as sons of obedience <span class="tei tei-q">“to help
our Vicar set by Apostolic authority”</span>.

The Bishop of Thessalonica, in the course of 200 years
since St. Leo and the succeeding Popes had made him
their Vicar for the great province of Eastern Illyricum,
had become a prelate of very high rank. Paul was
actually bishop, but he favoured the new heresy, and the
Pope, after warning him in vain,<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href="#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a> wrote deposing him,
unless he received without the least omission everything
which had been synodically ratified and defined at the
Council. At the same time he wrote to the people of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Thessalonica, enjoining them to have no society, agreement,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus, in the case of any diocese, whether that of a
simple bishop, or a primate, or a patriarch, the Pope
does not hesitate to tell their several diocesans that
they are set free from all duty of obedience to one condemned
by him. No act can show the superior
authority of the universal Primate more strongly than
this. St. Gregory the Great had said that all bishops
were equal when performing their respective work in
their own diocese; but if that work is not duly performed,
he knows of no bishop who is not subject to the
Apostolic See. The power of the Primacy is essentially
for edification of the whole Church, and so is exerted
whenever the Church and the faith of the Church are
anywhere in danger. The acts of St. Martin I. at a crisis
of singular danger follow exactly the rule of St. Gregory.
If an emperor supports heresy, he condemns his act,
though he may be a lawful sovereign; if a patriarch is
false to the faith, he sets a vicar of his own to appoint
fresh bishops in the patriarchate. If his own vicar sins
against the power which appointed him, he dissolves the
primary bond according to which the people of that
diocese is bound to their own bishop.

But the supreme authority of the Roman See is indicated

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I give the main contents of this letter thus addressed
to the whole world to announce the decision of the
Council by Pope Martin. It expresses in every line,
supported by constant quotations of Scripture, the
solicitude of the Pope for the maintenance of the doctrine
concerning the Person of the Lord which had been held
from the beginning. <span class="tei tei-q">“Our predecessors, the Pontiffs of
Catholic memory, have not ceased to admonish the innovators
to recede from this their heresy. Bishops from
various provinces, and, what is more, general synods,
have not only by their own writings called upon them
to amend their heresy, but conjure our Apostolic See to
exercise its regular authority, and not to suffer to the
end this innovation to make a prey of the churches.
Meeting, therefore, in this Roman most Christian city,
we have confirmed by our sentence the holy Fathers;
we have anathematised the heretics with their most depraved
doctrines, the impious Ecthesis and the most impious
Typus, in order that all you who dwell over the whole
earth, recognising that these things have been piously
done by us for the safeguard of the Catholic Church,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
may carry them out together with us.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord
says, every kingdom divided against itself shall not
stand, and every sentence, every law divided against itself
shall not stand; and if the Typus destroys the
Ecthesis, and the Ecthesis destroys the Typus, the one
asserting that our Lord has one will and operation, the
other denying it, then both are divided; and how shall
the heresy stand, being shown to be invalid and empty
by itself, rather than destroyed by us?”</span> This, the never-ending
refutation of heresy, runs through the whole
letter, and against it is set <span class="tei tei-q">“the manifestation of God
through apostles, prophets, doctors, and the five
Universal Councils, whose decrees are the law of the
Catholic Church”</span>. <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold the Judge stands before
the door joyfully promising crowns to those who suffer
for His sake.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus the Lateran Council of 649, presided over by
Pope Martin, who directs all the proceedings, who
informs the emperor of the condemnation of the Typus,
composed by this emperor's own patriarch, and issued
by himself as a law, who addresses an encyclical letter
to all bishops and their people, summing up its acts,
who writes to various provinces, and in particular to
the eastern patriarchates of Antioch and Jerusalem,
appointing his vicar over them, gives us in full detail a
picture of the discipline existing in the Church just at
the middle of the seventh century. As to doctrine, the
Lateran Council stands precisely on that set forth two
hundred years before at the Council of Chalcedon by
the great authority of St. Leo. In condemning the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Monothelite heresy, espoused by two emperors and three
successive patriarchs of Constantinople, it alleges the
tradition of the Fathers from the beginning, and the
doctrinal decrees of the five Councils, then accepted as
General. During these five centuries the East has been
agitated almost without ceasing by the efforts of the
Eutychean heresy and its last progeny, the Monothelite,
to overthrow the true faith concerning the Incarnation,
on which the whole economy of human salvation rests.
The eastern patriarchates have utterly failed to secure
the occupants of the sees of Alexandria, Antioch,
Jerusalem, and Constantinople, from the prevailing
error. Cyrus, patriarch of Alexandria, and Sergius,
patriarch of Constantinople, are the chief patrons of
this error. After them, Pyrrhus, and then Paul, are
using the utmost power of the emperor from their seat
in the capital to impose it by force: and the ecumenical
patriarch especially is using it as a lever against the
Roman Primacy, and in drawing up decrees of doctrine
fathered by the imperial power is practically denying
the Roman Primacy to be the guardian of the Christian
faith, and striving to transfer that guardianship to
himself, always under the wing of the emperor. Had
the Popes yielded to the Ecthesis or the Typus, both
the faith of the Church would have been altered, and
its government transferred from Old Rome to Roma
Nova. St. Martin, as the first act of his pontificate,
plays this most remarkable part of summoning a Council
which defeats this double aggression. And the moment
at which it is done may be marked as that in which the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
temporal weakness of Rome touches its lowest point.
The subsequent treatment of the Pope, which I have
now to mention, is an incontestable proof how entirely
he was exposed to the machinations, the violence, and
the despotic tyranny of his enemies, especially to the
malevolent union of emperor and patriarch. Yet it is
to be observed that neither emperor nor patriarch even
affects to deny the authority of St. Peter's successor;
what they attempt to do is to control and subject him
in the exercise of it.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
History is silent as to events in Rome from the end
of the Council of 649 to 653. What the exarch Olympius,
by special command of the emperor Constans II.
did while it was being held, has been narrated above.
Olympius was dead, but another exarch, Theodore
Kalliopas, was sent from Constantinople to execute
the work in which Olympius had failed. On the 15th
June, 653, Kalliopas came to Rome. Concerning his
purpose, Pope Martin himself wrote to his friend
Theodorus in these words:<a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href="#note_43"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“Your charity has desired
to know how I was carried away from the See of the
Apostle, St. Peter, like a solitary sparrow from the
house-top. I am surprised at your question since Our
Lord foretold of evil times to His own disciples: for
<span class="tei tei-q">‘there shall be then great tribulation, such as hath not
been from the beginning of the world until now; and
unless those days had been shortened, no flesh should
be saved. But he who perseveres unto the end shall be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
saved.’</span> Therefore that you may know how I was
removed and carried off from the city of Rome, you
shall hear no false report. Through the whole time I
knew what was preparing. And taking with me all my
clergy, I remained by myself in the church of our
Saviour, named after Constantine, which was the first
built and endowed in all the world by that emperor of
blessed memory, beside the bishop's palace. There we
all stayed by ourselves from Saturday, when Kalliopas
entered the city with the army of Ravenna, and the
chamberlain Theodorus. I sent them some of the clergy
to meet him, whom he received in the palace,<a id="noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href="#note_44"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a> and
thought I was with them. But, finding I was not, he
mentioned it to the chief clergy. Because it was our
purpose to do him homage,<a id="noteref_45" name="noteref_45" href="#note_45"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a> but on the next day, which
was Sunday, we would present ourselves and salute him,
as on that day we could not. On Sunday he sent men
to that church, suspecting that there was a great multitude
there, being Sunday, and he reported that, being
very tired with his journey, he could not come that day,
but we should certainly meet the next day, <span class="tei tei-q">‘and we will
do homage to your Holiness’</span>. Now I myself had been
very sick from October to that 16th of June. On
Monday then he sent at dawn his chartular and certain
attendants, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘You have prepared arms and you
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have armed men inside, and you have heaped up a
quantity of stones for resistance. This is not necessary;
do not allow any such thing.’</span> I heard this myself, and
to remove their suspicions, thought it necessary to send
them all over the episcopal palace, that, if they saw
arms or stones, they might themselves give evidence.
They went and found nothing, upon which I suggested
to them that they had always acted thus, and proceeded
against us by intrigue and false accusation, as when,
at the coming of the infamous Olympius, they said that
I might have repelled him by arms. Now I was lying
in my bed before the altar of the church, and scarcely
half-an-hour later the army came with them into the
church. All were covered, bearing lances and swords,
shields, and bows ready bent; and they did things there
which are not to be uttered. For, as when the winter
wind blows violently, the leaves fall from the trees, the
candles of the church were struck down, and resounded
in their fall upon the pavement. And the clash of arms
sounded like a horrible thunder in the church, together
with the vast number of broken candles. Upon this
their sudden inroad, order was issued by Kalliopas to
the priests and deacons who surrounded me, that I had,
in violation of rule and law, taken undue possession of
the bishop's office, and was not worthy to be in the
Apostolic See, but was by all means to be sent to this
imperial city, and a bishop elected in my stead. This
has not yet been done, and I trust will never be done;
since, in the absence of the pontiff, the archdeacon, the
archpriest, and the first notary take his place. I have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
already told you the acts which had been doing concerning
the faith. But, as we were not prepared for
resistance, I thought it better to die ten times over than
that anyone's blood should be shed in vain. And this
was done without risk to anyone, after many evils
displeasing to God had been effected. So I gave
myself up at once to be taken before the emperor
without resistance. I must admit that some of the
clergy cried out to me not to do this, but I did
not listen, lest murders should instantly take place.
But I said to them: Let some of the clergy necessary to
me, bishops, priests, and deacons, and, indeed, such as I
choose, come with me. Kalliopas answered: By all means
let such as will come. We use compulsion on no one.
I answered, My clergy are in my own hands. Some of the
priests cried out: We live and we die with him. Then
Kalliopas himself and these who were with him began
saying, Come with us to the palace. I did not refuse,
but on that same Monday went out with them to the
palace. On Tuesday all the clergy came to me, and many
had prepared to sail with me, and had already put their
baggage on board; some others also, both clergy and
laity, were hastening to join us. On that same night
then, preceding Thursday, the 19th June, about the
sixth hour, they carried me from the palace, thrusting
back all who were with me in the palace, and without
even things necessary for my journey and for me when
here, and they took me from the city with only six pages
and a single drinking vessel. We were put on board
a bark, and about four hours after dawn reached Porto.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
As soon as we left Rome the gates were closed, and kept
closed that no one might go out and reach us at Porto
before we sailed thence. Thus we were compelled to
leave at Porto all the goods of those who had put them
on board, and the same day we departed. On the 1st
July we came to Miseno, where was the ship, that is, my
prison. Now I met with no compassion, not in Miseno
only but also in Calabria; nor in Calabria only, which is
subject to the great city of the Romans, but in many
islands in which we were detained for our sins as
long as three months, save only in the island of Naxus,
for there we spent a year, I was allowed to take two or
three baths, and was a guest in a house. And now for
seven and forty days I have not been allowed to wash in
warm or cold water. I am sick and cold through and
through; for both on board and on land to the present
hour my stomach has allowed me no rest. When in my
hunger I am about to take something, my whole body is so
shaken that I cannot take anything to strengthen
nature. I have an utter disgust against what I have.
But I believe in the power of God, who beholds all
things, for when I am relieved from this present life all
my persecutors will be called to account, so that at least
they may be drawn to repent, and so converted from
their iniquity. God preserve you my very dear son.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The allusion above concerning the things done as to
the faith is explained in a former letter to the same
friend, wherein he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“When I left the Lateran
Church, where armed men had shut me in, they cried
out in the presence of the exarch, Whoever says or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
believes that Martin has changed or will change one
iota of the faith, let him be anathema. And whoever
remain not in their orthodox faith to death, let them be
anathema. When Kalliopas heard this he began to
excuse himself that there was no other faith than what
we held, and that he had no other. And I would have
you know, most dear brother, concerning the faith, and
likewise those calumnies which they are putting out
against the truth, that by the help of your prayers, and
those of all faithful Christians who are with you, whether
living or dying, I will defend the faith of our salvation,
and as St. Paul teaches, <span class="tei tei-q">‘to me to live is Christ, and to die
gain’</span>. But as to those false accusations which heretics
are newly making, casting aside the truth of Christ our
God, what truth can they speak to men who resist God's
truth? Therefore, I make answer to you, dearest
brother, by Him Who will judge this world by fire, and
render to every one according to his work, I never sent
letters to the Saracens, nor how they should understand
a certain tome, nor ever sent money, except some alms
to servants of God going thither, to whom we gave a
little for their needs, by no means for the Saracens. And
as to our Lady, the glorious ever-virgin Mary, who
brought forth Jesus Christ our God and Lord, whom all
holy and Catholic fathers call the Mother of God, inasmuch
as she bore the God-man, unjust men have borne
false witness against me—rather against their own souls.
Whoever does not honour and worship her who is
blessed above every creature and human nature save Him
who was born of her, the venerable ever-virgin Mother
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of our Lord, let him be anathema both in this world and
in the next. But men who seek occasion throw up
scandals for the offence of many. God preserve you,
most loving son.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In addition to these letters of the Pope himself, we
also possess from the hand of a contemporary<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href="#note_46"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“a
narration of the deeds done cruelly and without respect
of God by the adversaries of truth to the apostolic
confessor and martyr Martin, Pope of Rome”</span>. Concerning
this the writer says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Some incidents I learnt
from others; of very many I was an eye-witness”</span>. He
speaks with horror of the swords drawn against the Pope
as he lay sick on his couch in the Lateran Basilica;
how the preacher of truth was torn from his apostolic
throne by the powerful of this world who were worthy
of such a ministry; how he was carried off secretly in
a small vessel; how, as his ship touched at various
places, the bishops and faithful brought him gifts, which
the brutal guards laid their hands upon, abusing those
who brought them, and saying: If you love him you
are enemies of the State. <span class="tei tei-q">“When at last that blessed
man reached Byzantium on the 17th September, the
guards left him from morning until the tenth hour
lying in his couch on the ship, a spectacle to angels and
men. For a number of men came to him—wolfish from
their manners I should call them—as I conjecture hired
to do against the holy Pope things which should not be
mentioned to Christians. Now I remained on the shore
walking up and down the whole day, mourning over him
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whom I saw in such a state; and hearing what some
heathens said against him, I was ready to expire with
grief. About sunset a certain scribe named Sadoleva
came with many warders. They took him from the
ship and carried him in a portable chair to the guardhouse,
Prandiaria, and shut him up under strict charge
that no one in the city should know that he was kept in
guard. Thus the holy apostolical remained without
exchanging a word with anyone for ninety-three days.
On the ninety-third day they took him early out of
guard and put him in the fiscal's cell. They had summoned
the whole Senate to meet. They had him
brought in upon his chair, for he was ill from what he
had suffered on board and the long imprisonment. The
fiscal, who presided with the other chief persons, eyed
him from a distance, and bade him rise from his couch.
Some attendant said he could not stand. The fiscal
called out in a fury, and some one of the warders, Let
him stand up, though he be supported on both sides.
This was done. Then the fiscal said: Speak, wretch,
what harm has the emperor done thee? Has he taken
anything? Has he oppressed thee? But he held his
peace. Then the fiscal said to him with imperious
voice: Answerest thou nothing? Now shall thy accusers
come in. Then many accusers were brought in against
him. But they were all sons of falsehood, and disciples
of those who killed our Lord Jesus Christ. But they
contradicted the holy man, as they had been told; for
their words were arranged and prepared. Now some of
them tried to speak the truth, but those who directed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this conflict got disturbed, and began to threaten them
violently until they were induced to say what told for
the death of this just man. When the Pope looked at
them as they entered to bear witness, he said with a
smile: Are these the witnesses? That is the rule.
Some of these had been with Olympius. They were
sworn on the Gospels, and so bore witness. The first
of all the accusers was Dorotheus, patrician of Sicily.
He swore that if Martin had fifty heads he ought not to
live, since he alone subverted and destroyed all the
West, and was in fact in the counsel of Olympius, and
an enemy who slew the emperor and the Roman
civilisation. When that just man saw them coming in
and swearing unsparingly, out of compassion to their
souls he said to those who presided: For God sake do
not make them swear, but let them say what they
please on their simple word; and yourselves, do what
pleases you. Why should they lose their souls by
swearing? One witness came in and said that the
Pope had conspired with Olympius, and tampered with
soldiers to make them take an oath. When he was
asked if this was true, he answered: If you will hear
the truth, I will tell you. And he began to speak:
<span class="tei tei-q">‘When the Typus was made and sent to Rome by the
emperor—’</span> At these words he was stopped, and
Troilus cried out: Do not introduce before us matters
of faith; you are now on trial for treason, since we are
both Romans, and Christian, and orthodox. Would to
God, said the Pope; but on that day of tremendous
judgment you will find me a witness in this also. As
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the witnesses were accusing, Troilus, the prefect, said to
him: What a man art thou to have seen and heard the
attempts of Olympius against the emperor, yet not to
have forbidden him, but to have consented with him. To
whom the Pope instantly replied: Lord Troilus, tell us
when George, as you know and we have heard, who had
been a monk, and was become a magistrate, entered
into this city from the camp, and said and did such and
such things, where were you and those with you to
offer no resistance, though he harangued you and
banished from the palace such as he chose? And again,
when Valentine, at the emperor's command, put on the
purple and sat by his side, where had you gone? Were
you not here? Why did you not forbid him to meddle
with things not belonging to him? Did you not all
take part with him? How was I to stand against such
a man who wielded the whole force of Italy? Did I
make him exarch? I entreat you by the Lord to do
quickly what is your pleasure to do with me. For God
knows that you bestow on me the greatest of gifts by
whatever death you kill me. The fiscal enquired of one
of the officers, Sagoleva: Are there many more witnesses?
There are many, my lord, he said. But the
presidents, being foiled by the holy man standing before
them, because the Holy Spirit supported him, said it
was sufficient. A certain Innocentius was turning into
Greek the Pope's words, and the fiscal, feeling them like
fiery darts shot upon them, turned to Innocentius in a
fury: Why do you translate his words? Repeat them
not. And rising with his assessors he went in to report
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the emperor what he chose. But they led the holy
apostolic man, seated in his chair, away from the cell of
judgment—I should rather say from the hall of Caiphas—and
put him in the middle of a court opposite the
imperial stable, where all the people used to meet and
await the entry of the fiscal. The guards surrounded
him, and it was a sight striking awe into the crowd.
Presently they placed him in the open, that the emperor
might look at him from his dining-couch, and see what
followed. Now there was a great multitude of people
crowded together as far as the hippodrome. So they
placed the most reverend man in the middle of that
open space in presence of the whole Senate, propped up
on both sides. Suddenly there was a great press, and
the fiscal issuing from the emperor, with the doors of the
dining-room opened, ordered all the people to make way
for him. And, coming up to the holy Martin, the
Apostolicus said to him: See how God has led thee
and delivered thee into our hands. What hope hadst
thou in struggling against the emperor? Thou hast
deserted God, and God has deserted thee. And the
fiscal calling on one of the warders standing by ordered
him instantly to take away the mantle of the chief
pastor of all Christians, who had confirmed the orthodox
confession of the holy Fathers and Councils, that is, the
Faith, and had canonically and in council put under
anathema the authors of the new error, the new heretics,
with their impious doctrines. So when the warder had
torn away his mantle and the straps of his sandals, the
fiscal delivered him over to the prefect of the city,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
saying: Take him, my lord prefect, and immediately cut
him in pieces. At the same time he bade all who were
present anathematise him, which they did, but only
about twenty souls. But all who saw this deed, and
knew that there is a God in heaven who beheld what
was being done, went away disturbed, with eyes cast
down and in great sorrow.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Then the executioners taking him, stripped off the
pallium of the sacerdotal stole, and rending the sides of
his garment, which was woven from the top throughout,
put iron chains upon his holy neck, and dragging his
whole body violently, did not allow him to rest a
moment and recover himself, but led him from the
palace, making a show of him and dishonouring him
through the midst of the city to the pretorium. And the
sword was borne before him. Now, that blessed one was
in great and unspeakable pain. He was utterly worn
out and without strength, ready to expire from the
pressure of sufferings and his emaciation. Nevertheless,
rejoicing in hope, he was comforted in the Lord, and the
greater the affliction and violence with which he was
dragged along, the more that Just One followed with
serene countenance and unbroken spirit. He had but
one garment, which was rent from top to bottom, and no
girdle; but he was girded with faith and the grace of the
Lord. You might see a man so full of God subject to
such disgrace that his flesh might be seen naked. When
the people saw many things which happened they
groaned and sobbed. But a few of those ministers of
Satan rejoiced and mocked, and shaking their heads, as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is written, they said, Where is his God, and where is his
faith, and where is his teaching? And when he had
come to the pretorium in this dishonour, and surrounded
by the executioners with drawn swords, they cast him
into a prison with murderers, and about an hour later
carried him thence to the guard-house of Diomedes, in
the court of the prefect. But they drew him in his
fetters with such haste and force that his legs and
thighs were torn, and blood shed in ascending the stairs
of the guard-house, which were very ragged, rough and
steep. Now the blessed one was very nigh to escape the
tortures of the present life by expiring before the sword
came when he had no strength to mount the steps with
the men dragging him. When at last they got him
somehow into the guard-house, after many falls and
risings again, they put him on a bench clothed in fetters.
For when he was delivered by Caiphas, that is, the
prefect, to Pilate<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a> to be crucified, immediately when the
executioners were stripping him, he suffered greatly
from the cold, for it was a bitter season. They put on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
him the heaviest iron fetters, and there was no man of
his own to help him, save one young cleric, who stayed
with him in custody, and stood weeping over his master,
like Peter. The chief warder also was fastened to him,
it being the custom that a criminal condemned to the
sword should be bound to the chief warder.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Now, there were two women, a mother and a daughter,
who kept the keys of the guard-house. These witnessed
the unendurable suffering of that holy man (for besides
all his other punishments he was shivering with cold) and
out of compassion sought to show some mercy to him
and to cover him, but did not venture because of the
warder who was bound to him. For they thought that
the order for his execution would come at once. But
after some hours when some soldiers below had summoned
the chief warder he went down, and one of these
women, touched with pity, came, and folding in her arms
the champion of Christ and apostolic father, carried him
and rested him on her own bed, carefully covering him
and wrapping him. Now he remained to the evening
without uttering a word. But in the evening Gregorius,
the eunuch, prefect of the chamberlains, sent his majordomo
with a little food to refresh him, saying, Faint not
in your tribulations; we trust in God you will not die.
The blessed one groaned at this increase of his troubles.
Immediately they took off his fetters.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The next day the emperor went to the patriarchal
palace to visit the patriarch Paul, for he was near death.
The emperor told him all that had been done to the
holy man. But Paul groaned, and turning his face to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the wall he said: Woe is me, this also has been done to
multiply the judgments upon me. The emperor asked
why he said this. He replied: Is it not miserable, my
Lord, that pontiffs should suffer such things. Then he
earnestly adjured the emperor that the past sufferings
were sufficient, and that he should bear no more. When
this was heard by that apostolical man, who did not
receive what he was expecting, he was not pleased with
that promise, but was made quite sad, for he was
longing to finish a good fight, and to depart unto Him
Whom he desired.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The patriarch Paul died, and Pyrrhus who had been
patriarch before him was trying to recover his seat, but
the retractation which he had offered to the Pope
Theodorus was brought up against him. The emperor
sent an officer, an assistant of the fiscal, to examine
Pope Martin about it. Demosthenes entering said to
the Pope: See in what great glory you were, and to
what you have reduced yourself. Nobody did this to
you, but you did it to yourself. The Pope made no
answer except, Glory and thanksgiving for all things
to the sole immortal King. His majesty, said Demosthenes,
has instructed you thus: inform us of what
passed in the case of the expatriarch Pyrrhus here, and
at Rome afterwards. Why did he go to Rome? Was
it by order, or of his own accord? The Pope answered,
Of his own accord. Demosthenes said, How did he
draw up that paper? Under any one's compulsion?
The Pope replied, Under none but of himself. Demosthenes
said: When Pyrrhus came to Rome, how did
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Pope Theodorus, your predecessor, receive him? as a
bishop? The Pope replied with tranquillity, And why
not? Before Pyrrhus came to Rome, blessed Theodorus
wrote hither, that is to Paul, who had acted unfittingly,
and invaded another's see. When afterwards Pyrrhus
came to Rome, to the threshold of St. Peter, how should
not my predecessor receive and honour him as a bishop?
Demosthenes said, That is most true. But where did he
get what was most needful for his support? The Pope
said, Clearly from the Roman patriarchal palace. The
assistant remarked: What sort of bread was given to
him? The Pope said, My Lords, do you not know the
Roman Church? For I tell you whoever in however
poor a plight comes hither to lodge, all things for his
need are given him, and St. Peter sends away none who
come without his gifts; the best bread and various wines
are given both to him and to his attendants. If this is
done in the case of the abject, when one comes in the
honour of a bishop, what treatment should he receive?
Demosthenes said, We have been informed that Pyrrhus
was forced to make that statement at Rome, that he
bore wooden fetters, and suffered much. The Pope
replied, Nothing of the kind was done. For unless
some are kept in their place by fear, they cannot speak
out the truth. There are many at Constantinople who
were then at Rome, and know what took place there.
The patricius Plato survives, who was then exarch, and
who directed some of his men then to Pyrrhus at Rome.
Ask him if I speak falsely about this. But why enquire
further? I am in your hands. Do with me what you
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
will. As God allows, it is in your power. If you cut
me to pieces, as when you delivered me to the prefect,
you ordered, I do not communicate with the Church of
Constantinople. I am here: examine me, and try, and
you will find by experience the grace of God and of His
faithful servants.</span> Again Pyrrhus was mentioned, who
had been so often anathematised, and stripped of the
sacred honour. Demosthenes and his assistant were
astonished at the tranquil Pope's boldness and constancy
for Christ unto death. For this his chalice of
passion was ordained. The attendants also were amazed:
they made a copy of all which the blessed man had said
and retired.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Now the most reverend Pope passed in that same
guard-house of Diomedes eighty-five days after the
first ninety-three, that is, in all one hundred and seventy-eight
days. Then Sagoleva the scribe came, saying, I
am commanded to take you hence, and to remove you
to my house, and after two days to conduct you
whither the fiscal shall command. The Pope asked
whither he was to be taken; the other refused to say.
Then the holy man asked that he might be allowed to
remain in the same guard-house until he was banished,
and might be taken direct from it, which also was
refused him. But about sunset the venerable Pope said
to those who were in the prison: Approach, brethren,
and let us take leave; behold he is at hand who will
take me hence. And as he said this they each drank of
the chalice. And rising with serene countenance, with
much firmness and thanksgiving he said to one of those
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
present dear to him: Sir, my brother, come and give me
the kiss of peace. Now the heart of that brother, as he
told me himself at that very time, was, I conceive, such
as the heart of that disciple who watched his Lord upon
the cross. And as he was giving the kiss of peace to
the most holy Pope, through the depth of their affection
they shed a flood of tears. But all present broke into
a terrible lamentation. The blessed man distressed at
this, besought them not to do so, looking at them
undisturbed. And placing his venerable hands upon
his head, said with a smile: Sir, my brother, this is
good, this is seasonable—should you act thus? Is it
for our peace? Rather you should rejoice over me
now. To whom the brother with deep contrition
answered: Servant of Christ, God knows. I rejoice in
the glory with which Christ our God has deigned that
you should suffer all these things for His Name's sake;
but I am sad for the perdition of all. Then all paying
him their respects retired. So the scribe coming forth
at once took him away and brought him to his own
house. It was said then that he was banished to
Cherson, and a few days afterwards we learnt that the
holy Apostolical man had been carried thither in a
vessel secretly.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Upon his arrival he wrote a letter after a few days to
a most dear friend in Byzantium, one of those who
loved him for the Lord's sake and for his right faith.
And this our father was in banishment and great tribulation,
and on account of his many and severe bodily sicknesses,
and the every way defective supply of that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
country, where nothing was to be found, particularly
bread, which they knew by name, but not in fact, asked
for certain things to be sent him. Thus he wrote,
attesting upon oath that a small bark touched there,
carrying a little wheat in exchange for salt, and they
were scarcely able to get a bushel of wheat for four coins,
and that with much entreaty. That holy soul wrote
that he was suffering various distresses there, not only
from his own body, but through the oppression of those
who ruled there, under direction from the lord in
Byzantium, so that he was dying miserably. I then,
your humble and sinning servant, beseech you, Fathers
honourable in God, since I have declared to you what
I myself saw and most carefully heard from others, that
is, the trials pressing on our most blessed Pope for his
right confession in Christ our Lord, and for his anathema
uttered upon the new heretics. Short as is my account
out of many things, but the best I could send you,
do you for your part set forth these things to those who
have zeal for God's worship, and beseech them to imitate
him, and to maintain the traditions of the holy fathers,
as he has done, and to hold no communion with those
of an opposite mind. Entreat also for me, your unworthy
servant, the writer, that, together with him and
with you, I may find mercy from Christ our Lord for
ever. Amen.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We possess two letters written by the Pope from the
Crimea to his friend in Byzantium, which would seem to
be the letters referred to by the writer I have just
quoted. In them the Pope declares the extreme need
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of necessaries for life, in which he suffers. In the first
he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“If St. Peter thus supports strangers at Rome,
what shall we say of ourselves, who are his proper servants,
and at least for a time ministered to him, and are
in such a banishment and affliction”</span>. In the second his
words are still more pressing: <span class="tei tei-q">“I am astonished at the
inattention and want of compassion of all who once belonged
to me, of my friends and relations who are so
utterly forgetful of my misery and care not to know, as
I find by experience, whether I am or am not upon the
earth. Much more still do I wonder at those who are
of the most holy Church of the Apostle Peter, since they
have taken such pains for their own body and member—that
is, for their affection to us—that we may be without
solicitude. For if the Church of St. Peter possess not
gold, at least, by the grace of God, it is not without
wheat and wine and other necessaries whereby at least
to show a moderate care of us. What fear has fallen
upon men that they should not do the commands of God?
Have I appeared such an enemy to the whole fulness of
the Church, and an adversary to them? But may God,
who wishes all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge
of the truth by the intercession of St. Peter, establish
their hearts in the orthodox faith, and confirm them
against every heretic and person adversary to our Church,
and maintain them unshaken, especially the pastor who
is now declared to rule them, so that failing, declining,
surrendering no whit of the things which they have writtenly

The <span class="tei tei-q">“present pastor,”</span> whom Pope Martin thus seems
to recognise was Pope Eugenius, elected at Rome in his
lifetime, through dread, it is said, of the clergy there
that the Emperor Constans II. would force upon them
some Monothelite of his own to sit in the See of Peter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The last scene is thus described, as appended to the
foregoing narrative:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The most holy thrice blessed Apostolical, Martin
the Pope, a true confessor and martyr of Christ our God,
died in his banishment in the Crimea, according to his
own petition to our Lord God, offered to Him with tears
at the moment that he disembarked and trod that land—that
is, that in it he might finish his life, fighting the good
fight, finishing his course of martyrdom, keeping the
good faith, on the 16th September, the day on
which in the year's course the most precious and blessed
memory is kept of the martyr Euphemia, guardian of
the orthodox faith.<a id="noteref_49" name="noteref_49" href="#note_49"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a> He was buried about a stadium

of all creatures, the fullest of grace, the maker and giver
of joy, the ever-Virgin Mary, Mother of God. By the
intercessions of which Virgin and confessor may Christ
our true God and Saviour, who came forth from her for
the human race in a manner ineffable and without seed,
guard and protect us, and all faithful hearers, and all
the people whom He has acquired unto sincere faith and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So Pope Martin I. gave up his life for the faith of
Christ and for the independence of the Church, and no
less for that guardianship of both which is vested in the
Holy See. For he was thus treated because he held a
Council at the Lateran expressly condemning an imperial
document of the reigning sovereign called a Typus, and
as Pope placed it under anathema, and published his
Encyclical <span class="tei tei-q">“to the whole sacred plenitude of the Church”</span>.
And he was condemned as a traitor, exactly repeating
the passion of his Lord, as he sat in the seat of him to
whom our Lord said, Follow thou Me. And further, he
followed his great predecessor, Pope Clement I., the
personal friend both of St. Peter and St. Paul, and the
third successor of St. Peter, dying in the Crimea, where
St. Clement died by command of the great heathen
emperor Trajan, as St. Martin died by command of
Constans II., a successor of Constantine, and by his
office as <span class="tei tei-q">“Christian prince and Roman Emperor”</span> the

In Two.</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We left the emperor Heraclius carrying back the true
Cross in triumph to Jerusalem from its captivity under
the Persian fire-worshipper, whose empire he had
wounded to death. This was in the year 629, in the
pontificate of Honorius, and in that act the emperor
seated at Byzantium, on the throne of Constantine, at
the head of the empire which was the proper creation
of Constantine, seemed to have made himself the champion
of the faith which is embodied in the Cross. Had
Heraclius then died it would have been with a halo not
only of human but of Christian glory surrounding his
head. But he survived during twelve years in which
his inertness, considered by some to be unexplained,
suffered the eastern empire to undergo irreparable losses.
These, moreover, came from a foe of whose mere existence
he was indeed conscious, but of whom he had no
fear at the time of that triumphal entry into Jerusalem.
An obscure Arabian raider was striving to gain a
mastery among some savage tribes in that little known
peninsula. The lord of the golden city, seated as queen
of Europe and Asia on broad-flowing Hellespont, would
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hardly deign to cast his eyes upon an incursion of
southern robbers, made on an empire which for three
hundred years had been watching war-clouds big with
tempests from the north, or matching itself with difficulty
against the restored Sassanid kingdom. This at
last was beaten down. Might not Constantinople hail
in security the return of an emperor who had conquered
Persia? But we, looking back over the ages, may think
that the act of Heraclius replacing the Cross in the
Holy City and in the church which Constantine had
built over the sepulchre of Christ may be called with
much truth the last act of the real Cæsarean empire,
inasmuch as during the twelve succeeding years it lost
for ever its greatest provinces to the very foe whose
advent as a conqueror Heraclius had not even suspected.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have now to follow briefly one of the greatest
revolutions which has ever occurred in human affairs.
It is a revolution which not merely sets up one kingdom
instead of another, or alters the persons of individual
rulers; but which changes human society to its very
depths, provides a different standard of morals, and, so
far as it succeeds, but only so far, reverses the course of
Christian civilisation, and undoes in certain countries
the greatest conquests which the Christian Church had
obtained for the good of the human race. Not States
only are changed, but fathers and mothers, husbands
and wives, sons and daughters: in fine, Græco-Roman
heathenism has disappeared, but instead of it arises a
religion borne on the shoulders of a temporal rule, and
a legislation compared with which in certain respects
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that old heathenism was pure and benignant. The
revolution reaches in fact man's belief in the nature of
God Himself: and a change of belief in the nature of
God involves a change in all His relations to His
moral creatures, and in their relations to each other.
The creature in all action reproduces what it holds
concerning the Creator. The religion of self-sacrifice
springs from a God who sacrifices Himself: the religion
of self-indulgence from a God from whose worship
sacrifice has been expunged.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href="#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a>
appears that even before the triumphal entry of
Heraclius into Jerusalem with the recovered cross he had
met in the Persian campaigns, in 622 or 623, with a certain
bishop named Cyrus, then holding the see of Phasis, in
Armenia. But Cyrus himself had for years before
been in communication with Sergius, the powerful
patriarch of Constantinople, the guide and inspirer of
the emperor. Sergius had held the see of the capital
since the year 610, in which the accession of Heraclius
took place. It had been all along his dream to reconcile
the various monophysite sects which troubled his master's
empire. In the political point of view such a reconciliation
could not but appear very important. In Egypt
alone the Monophysites numbered about six millions,
against three hundred thousand orthodox.<a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href="#note_51"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a> How deeply
their national feeling was mixed up with their heresy is
shown by the name of Melchites or Royalists, which they
gave to their opponents. The patriarch Sergius and the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
emperor Heraclius fell upon the device of gaining the
heretical party, not only in Egypt, but in the Eastern
empire generally, to at least an outward union with the
orthodox by introducing the formula <span class="tei tei-q">“One Operation”</span>
as a theological expression for the acts of our Lord. St.
John of Damascus<a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href="#note_52"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a>
describes in his treatise on heresies
the 99th as that of the Monothelites <span class="tei tei-q">“who derived their
origin from Cyrus of Alexandria, and their strength from
Sergius of Constantinople. These men maintained two
Natures in Christ, and one Person, but assert one Will and
one Operation, by which they destroy the duality of
natures, and strongly adhere to the doctrines of Apollinarius.”</span>
Now Sergius, uniting great ability and strong
character to his position as bishop of the capital city and
minister of the Emperor Heraclius, dominated his mind.
Heraclius exerted himself greatly to disseminate the
formulary of these two patriarchs. His purpose was
that of drawing together his own distracted empire.
This purpose of Heraclius is carried back so far at least
as the year 628. Nay, at the beginning of his campaign
against the Persians he recommended it. How much
more when by the peace of the year 628 he recovered
the provinces which had been taken from him.<a id="noteref_53" name="noteref_53" href="#note_53"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a> It
would seem that the faltering of Heraclius in the faith,
which he was willing to subject to a deceptive compromise
the doctrine of the incarnation itself, was
coincident in time with the opening of the Mohammedan
era, the hegira or flight of Mohammed from Mecca,
which marks his assumption of the claim to propagate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by force a conquering religion. That claim was in a few
years to cost Heraclius the half of his empire. It is
certain that about the year 630 he promoted Cyrus to
be patriarch of Alexandria. He also put a certain
Athanasius of like doctrine into the see of Antioch, and
thus three patriarchal sees at once were in favour of the
heresy. And Sergius wrote to Pope Honorius commending
it as a wonderful mode of restoring unity to the
Church in the East.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Cyrus drew up nine heads of doctrine, by which he
thought that he had reconciled the Theodosians and
other powerful sects in Egypt. His announcement was
received with exceeding joy by Sergius at Constantinople.
Sergius wrote to Pope Honorius describing the action of
Cyrus in these words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Certain dogmatic heads were
agreed upon between the two sides, in consequence of
which those who but yesterday were parted into divisions
and acknowledged the wicked Dioscorus and Severus as
their ancestors, were united to the one most holy
Catholic Church, and all the people of Alexandria,
beloved by Christ, and besides this we may say all
Egypt and Thebais and Libya, and the other dioceses of
the Egyptian province, became one flock of Christ our
true God. They who were until then to be seen an
innumerable multitude of divided heresies, now, by the
good pleasure of God and the zeal well-pleasing to Him
of the most holy prelate of Alexandria, have all become
one, with one voice and unity of spirit, confessing the
true doctrines of the Church.”</span><a id="noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href="#note_54"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such was the picture set before Pope Honorius by the
patriarch Sergius, then in the height of his credit as
bishop of the imperial city and prime minister of the
emperor, in the year 633, when Abu Bekr was elected
the first of the chalifs to carry on the power of Mohammed,
who had died a few months before. A few years
after this supposed reunion of all, these same Egyptians
welcomed submission to Omar, the second chalif and
successor of Abu Bekr, as lord of Egypt, who would, as
they thought, be more favourable to them than Heraclius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And the successor of St. Peter was deceived into
believing that the picture drawn by Sergius was a true
statement.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But before the union described in such terms by
Sergius had been completed, a man had come to Alexandria,
who was to protest in the face of the whole
world against this compromise to which the Catholic
faith was being subjected. This was Sophronius, a
monk of high repute, to whom the patriarch Cyrus
showed the articles of union, while they were as
yet unpublished. Sophronius threw himself at the
patriarch's feet, and conjured him most earnestly not to
announce them from the pulpit, as they manifestly
expressed the heresy of Apollinaris. Sophronius did
not succeed with Cyrus, but carried a letter from him to
Sergius at Constantinople, to whom it would seem that
Cyrus directed him as the chief supporter and exponent
of the doctrine which Sophronius rejected.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All that Sophronius was able to obtain from Sergius
was that both expressions concerning the action of our
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Lord, as God-man, that is, the One Operation, or the
Two Operations, should be equally avoided. Sophronius
on his return to Jerusalem, was elected patriarch, and as
such, presently issued his synodical letter. This is
almost the most important document<a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55" href="#note_55"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a> in the whole
Monothelite struggle: a great theological treatise, which
embraces the Trinity and the Incarnation, and fully sets
forth the doctrine of the Two Operations in Christ.
Copies of it were sent to all the patriarchs. The copy
sent to Sergius has come down to us among the acts of
the 7th session of the 6th council. Out of the copy in
the acts I will here quote some few of the very words
in which the great champion of the faith states the
doctrine. It is that which St. Leo defined at the
Council of Chalcedon, for which Pope S. Martin offered
his life in sacrifice, for which the Popes preceding and
following him suffered trials and persecutions without
end, which four successive patriarchs of Constantinople
endeavoured to overthrow, and for their incessant
quarrels over which, three eastern patriarchates, with
their bishoprics, were delivered over as a prey to the
hordes of the false prophet.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sophronius<a id="noteref_56" name="noteref_56" href="#note_56"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">56</span></span></a> addressing his colleagues began with
regretting that he was advanced to the pontifical
throne from a very humble state against his will.
Begging his fathers and brethren to support him, he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
noted that it was an apostolic custom throughout the
world that they who were thus advanced, should attest
their faith to the colleagues preceding them. After this
introduction, Sophronius threw his words into the form
of a creed, in which the first part dwelt upon the
Trinity. He then, at greater length, set forth his belief
in the Incarnation. How God the Son, taking pity
upon the fall of man, by His own will, and the will of
His Father, and the divine good pleasure of the Spirit,
being of the infinite nature, incapable of circumscription
and of local passage, entered the virginal womb, resplendent
in its purity, of Mary the holy, the God-minded,
the free from every contamination of body, of soul, and
of mind;<a id="noteref_57" name="noteref_57" href="#note_57"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">57</span></span></a> the fleshless took flesh, the formless, in His
divine substance, took our form; the eternal God
becomes in truth man. He, who is in the bosom of the
eternal Father is bosomed in a mother's womb. He who
is without time receives a beginning in time. Then,
passing to the point in question, he went on: Christ is
One and Two, One in Person, Two in Natures and their
natural attributes. On this account, One and the same
Christ and Son, and Only-begotten is found undivided
in both natures. He worked physically the works of
each nature according to the essential quality or natural
property which belonged to each. This He could not
have done, had He possessed, as One only Person, so One
only Nature, not compounded. For then, the One and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Same would not have completely done the works of
each Nature. For when has Godhead without body
worked naturally the works of the body? or, when has a
body without Godhead worked works which substantially
belong to the Godhead? But Emmanuel, being One, and
in this Oneness both, that is, God and Man, did, in
truth, the works of each Nature; being One and the
Same, as God He did the divine, as Man the human
works. Being One and the Same, He works and He
speaks the divine and the human.<a id="noteref_58" name="noteref_58" href="#note_58"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a> Not one wrought
miracles, and another did human works, and suffered
pains, as Nestorius meant, but one and the same Christ
and Son wrought the divine and the human according
to each, as St. Cyril taught. In each of the Two Natures
He had the two powers unmingled, but undivided. As
He is eternal God, He wrought the miracles; as He was
Man in the last times, He wrought the inferior and
human works.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The answer to the Synodical letter of Sophronius,
made by Sergius at Constantinople, was not to receive it,
but to draw up his own Ecthesis, and prevail on the
emperor Heraclius to stamp it with the imperial signature,
and proclaim it as the faith of his empire. Before
the Ecthesis was brought to Rome in December, 638,
Pope Honorius had died in the preceding October.
Sophronius had commissioned the chief bishop of his
patriarchate, Stephen of Dor, as we have already seen,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to carry his appeal to Honorius, in the See of Peter.
And now it is time to turn to those events which were
in the meanwhile happening in the eastern empire.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the three hundred years from Constantine to his
twenty-second successor, Heraclius, the empire which he
had set up in the fairest city of the world had developed
into a double despotism. It is difficult to say whether
that despotism pressed more severely on the religious or
on the civil well-being of its subjects. As to each, it is
requisite to say something. The gravity of the events
which took place within ten years demands it; while in
their permanent effect that gravity most of all consists.
The immediate result was most rapid and unexpected,
yet a long train of action during the three hundred years
preceding had led straight up to it, and a period of four
times three hundred years has since witnessed its evolution.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us take first this pressure of despotism on religion.
In speaking of Constantine I noted that there were in
him two very distinct periods of his rule after he became
a Christian. The first precedes his acquisition of the
whole empire in 323; the second follows in the fourteen
years from that time to his death. But in this second
period the change, which dates from the moment at
which he becomes sole emperor, is yet gradual. At the
first General Council, in 325, the calling of which is
agreed to by the Pope and the eastern patriarchs, but
springs from himself, he acknowledges both in word and
conduct that the Christian Church is the kingdom of
Christ, and that its government lies in the hands of those
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
who receive a divine consecration thereto from Christ.
They are the witnesses of His doctrine, which they maintain
and promulgate in virtue of that consecration.
Upon this doctrine their judgment is final. Constantine
never in thought submitted to any power but the
Catholic Church. The thought of warring sects was abhorrent
equally to the soldier, the conqueror, and the
legislator. Yet before his reign closed, at the age of
sixty-three, he had been seduced in his conduct from
this high tone of action by the counsels of the Court
bishop, Eusebius; he had restored Arius and persecuted
Athanasius. He had selected the bishops who were to
attend local councils, while he stretched the powers of
such local councils beyond their competence. He had in
fact advanced with his imperial sword into the Church's
Council Chamber, and claimed to be a judge of her
doctrine. And his kingdom was forthwith divided<a id="noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href="#note_59"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">59</span></span></a>
among three sons, none of whom as rulers at all represented
their fathers majesty, while one, Constantius, became
after not many years the sole ruler, and as such propagated
the heresy of the day, and practised encroachment
on the doctrinal independence of the Church. Constantius
was cut off in his forty-fourth year, receiving
clinical baptism from the hands of an Arian on his death-bed.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
In twenty years after his death the imperial power
passes through two new families, and when a third is
called in to support a falling empire, Theodosius has
fifteen years given to him in which to save the empire
from imminent destruction and the eastern Church from
heresy. The victory of that Arian heresy during fifty
years had so deranged that eastern episcopate, that no
one but a saint and champion of the faith, such as St.
Basil,<a id="noteref_60" name="noteref_60" href="#note_60"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">60</span></span></a> could venture to describe its condition. From
the death of Theodosius, in 395, the eastern empire
passed through fifteen successors to Heraclius, and
in that succession there are ten changes of family.
One daughter of an emperor, who was himself a successful
insurgent, conferred the empire twice, both times on
the most worthless of men, as much marked for their
civil misgovernment as for persecution of the Church.
But with every step in the succession it may be noted
that the original independence of the Church, as recognised
by Constantine and by his successors down to the
Emperor Leo I. in a long series of imperial laws,<a id="noteref_61" name="noteref_61" href="#note_61"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">61</span></span></a> fell
more and more into the background. Each general
who by slaughtering his predecessor mounted the
eastern throne assumed at once the bearing of the lord
of the world: with the purple boots he put on the
imperial pride. The Roman Primacy was indeed acknowledged
by the Council of Chalcedon in 451, and no
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
less by the Emperor Marcian, the husband of the Theodosian
heiress. But twenty-five years after that Council the
western Emperor was abolished. From that moment
the sole Roman Emperor was seated at Byzantium. At
once an eastern schism was set up by the Bishop of the
Capital. Rome was in the possession of Teuton Arians,
who impaired the freedom of the Papal election, and made
the imperial confirmation of it a custom. And when at
last an honest general, who had entered the army as an
Illyrian peasant, and risen from the ranks to the throne,
had discountenanced the schism, condemned four successive
bishops of his own capital, and acknowledged in
amplest terms that the Pope's power was supreme,
and also that it consisted in descent from St. Peter, the
eastern emperor forbore, indeed, to deny the Primacy,
but his endeavour was to control its action by making
the spiritual subject to the civil power. This was the
outcome of Justinian's long reign from 527, to 565.
And the fatal conquest of Italy and Rome, making the
one to be a captive province, and the other to be the
garrisoned city, but not even the capital of a captive
province, aided Justinian in acts to undo the reverence
which in words he testified to the successor of St. Peter.
In eighty-five years, from 553 to 638, the occupant of
the eastern throne had advanced from holding a Council
at Constantinople without the Pope's consent, to presenting
at Rome a doctrinal decree for his signature. A
few years afterwards, when the Pope called a Council,
and condemned the decrees of two emperors as heresy,
and three successive bishops of Constantinople as the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
heretics who supported it, the grandson of Heraclius,
Constans II., tried the Pope as guilty of high treason
before the Senate of Byzantium, and crowned him with
martyrdom in exile. Step from Pope Vigilius a captive
guarded at Constantinople in 553, to Pope Martin sentenced
there as a traitor in 655, and dying in the Crimea
a martyr. That step will mark the advance of eastern
despotism and the peril of the Church's independence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it may be said that from the time Nestorius is
deposed as guilty of heresy made by himself from the
see of the capital in 431, to the publication of the
imperial Ecthesis as a rule of faith in 638, the eastern
patriarchates have been swaying backwards and forwards
between the two opposing heresies of Nestorius
and Eutyches: Syria is the parent of one: Egypt of
the other. Through these two centuries the bishop
of Byzantium has pursued under the emperor's never-failing
patronage a uniform course of self-aggrandisement.
In this he was greatly helped by the extinction
of the western emperor, when his master at Constantinople
became the sole representative of the Roman
name—that Christian king and Roman prince to whose
honour so many Popes from Felix III. onward so vainly
appealed. That very prince became step by step their
most dangerous enemy. The first act immediately
upon the extinction of the western emperor—who was
the natural defender of the Holy See—was that a
Byzantine bishop, Acacius, set himself up as the leader
of the whole eastern episcopate. Pope Gelasius told the
bishop of the day that he had no rank in the episcopate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
except that he was bishop of the capital: that a royal
residence could not make an apostolic See. The new
family of Justinian, ascending the eastern throne, was
compelled by the internal state of the east, to acknowledge
the Roman Primacy. Justinian never broke
from that acknowledgment, but he termed his own
bishop ecumenical patriarch in his laws: and every
Byzantine bishop clung to the title given by an absolute
sovereign. In the time of Pope Gregory the Great, a
hundred years after the decree of Pope Gelasius, recording
the pre-eminent rank and order of the three original
Petrine Sees, of Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch, the
Byzantine bishop is allowed to be a patriarch, Alexandria
and Antioch have fallen under him. They themselves
have been throughout all the intervening time the seats
of violent party spirit, the spirit of the two conflicting
heresies, striving for masterdom, disturbing succession
in the sees, and ready by any obsequious act to get on
their side the bishop of the capital, who dispenses the
smiles of the emperor. Against all primitive order that
bishop is found to consecrate his subordinate patriarchs
at Alexandria and Antioch: to put down one and to raise
another. When his usurpation was fresh and still incomplete,
the patriarch Theophilus could persecute St.
Chrysostom for the wrong done to Alexandria; but the
patriarch Cyrus, made for his subserviency to Heraclius
and Sergius to sit in the seat of St. Athanasius, addresses
Sergius as <span class="tei tei-q">“My Lord,<a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href="#note_62"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a> the thrice-blessed Father of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fathers, the ecumenical patriarch, Sergius, the least of
his servants,”</span> and his acts are as humble as his words.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is clear that the eastern patriarchal system had
fallen from intrinsic corruption before the joint operation
of Byzantine despotism and the ambition of the bishop
of the capital, who bought every accession to his own
power and influence by acting in ecclesiastical matters
as the instrument of the imperial will. This fall was
complete before the events which mark the last ten
years of the reign of Heraclius as a time of unequalled
and irretrievable disaster both to the Church and to the
State.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet something must still be added to portray that
civil condition of the State which led on to this disaster.
In all this time the city of the emperor's residence had
been exhausting of their wealth—by the terrible severity
of the imperial taxation—the provinces subject to it.
Egypt and Syria lived under a perpetual oppression no
less than Italy and Rome. Every distinction, every
favour, which Antioch, when Queen of the east, may
have brought to Syria, had long migrated to the banks
of the Bosphorus. All the national feeling of Egypt
was aggrieved by the ruler who treated the dower of
Cleopatra—the imperial gem of Augustus—as a storehouse
to be plundered at pleasure. And the national spirit
was intensified to fever heat by the hatred of Byzantium
on the part of the Eutychean population, forming the
vast majority in the whole country.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus the wide eastern empire instead of worshipping
in union of heart and gladness of spirit that transcendent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mystery in which is throned the grandeur and the
mercy of the Christian dispensation, instead of falling in
prostrate adoration before that vision of condescending
love which the angels desire to look into, broke itself into
endless conflicts in disputing about it, until the mystery
of grace became a rancorous jarring of ambitious rivals.
During more than 200 years this suicidal conflict was
engaged in ruining the resources of a vast dominion,
which in the hands of a Constantine or a Theodosius, with
the spirit of a St. Leo to guide them, would have been
impregnable to every enemy. Had emperor and people
been faithful to the Council of Chalcedon, and to the
authority which they admitted to be based on a divine
promise made to St. Peter, neither the disunited hordes
of the North, nor the far inferior savages of the South,
nor even the impact of the great Sassanide empire would
have availed to overcome the Roman power. This last
and greatest enemy Heraclius had subdued. He went
forth in the name of the Crucified One whom Chosroes
had called upon him to disavow, and won the fight. Yet
even as he was carrying back the Cross and entering
the Holy City in triumph, Heraclius had become a
traitor to him whom he was professing to honour. He
had already conceived, under an evil influence and by
the inspiration of the patriarch at his right hand, a
compromise of doctrine which he thought would induce
the rebellious Egyptian people to return to his allegiance.
He hoped also that the same compromise would exorcise
the Nestorian spirit at Antioch. They who did not
agree were to be drawn into an appearance of agreement
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by an ambiguous formula. And the See of the Apostle
Peter, last and greatest witness of the true doctrine,
was to be forced into accepting the deceit, and ratifying
it for the old truth by submitting to an imperial decree,
which, independent of the heresy contained in it, was a
violation of the Church's liberty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fifty years which run from 628 to 678 contain
the various acts of one prolonged attempt by the
Byzantine emperors to enforce their religious despotism
on the Pope in the shape of the Monothelite heresy.
The two standard-bearers of the heresy are two patriarchs,
Sergius at Constantinople, and Cyrus at Alexandria.
Precisely at this time the Mohammedan power appears
upon the scene. While Heraclius is brooding over the
compromise of Sergius for reuniting an empire dislocated
by heresy, Mohammed is purposing the foundation of
an empire resting on material force. While Heraclius
is assuming the right to define the doctrine of the
Church in virtue of his imperial power, Mohammed is
constructing a claim to prophetic rank from which
imperial power itself shall emanate. The Mohammedan
claim is the exact antithesis of the Byzantine usurpation:
the rise of a false prophet punishes the attempt among
Christians to rule the spiritual by the civil power.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Upon the death of Mohammed in 632, his companions
took counsel together and elected Abu Bekr to carry
on the dominion based upon religion which Mohammed
had invented. They gave him the title of <span class="tei tei-q">“Chalif of
God's Apostle”</span>. As the vicar of the new prophet, he
was to exert the absolute power which belonged to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
prophet's office, and of which the civil sovereignty was
an offshoot. This power was rooted in the belief that
Mohammed had been sent by God. The quality therefore
of every act exercised by the first chalif, and by
every successor, depended on the truth of such a mission.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By the choice of Abu Bekr, father of Aischa, the
favourite wife of Mohammed, it was resolved that the
succession to the chalifate should be elective, not
hereditary. The most stirring principle of the new
power was that everyone who died for its extension,
which was called the Holy War, should pass at once to
paradise. Paradise had been drawn by Mohammed
after his own sensual imagination to suit the taste of a
most sensual people. The empire sought by Mohammed
and his followers was to be imposed by force. Abu
Bekr stirred up the sons of the desert to this Holy
War, proclaiming that he who fought for God's cause
should have 700 good works counted for each step, 700
honours allotted to him, and 700 sins forgiven.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Abu Bekr held the chalifate but two years, dying
in 634 at the age of 63 years. But at the very time of
his death the pearl of Syria, Damascus, fell into the
hands of his generals, Amrou and Khaled. From
Medina the city of the prophet, and the seat of the
chalif, he had sent forth three armies. Moseilama, a
prophet who competed with Mohammed, was destroyed,
the discontented tribes in Arabia itself were reduced to
obedience. The Persian provinces on the Euphrates
were attacked. The Roman empire itself was summoned
to accept the new religion, or to become tributary.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Upon the death of Abu Bekr, the chief associates of
Mohammed around him proclaimed Omar as chalif, and
entitled him Chalif, and Prince of the Faithful. In the
ten years of his chalifate, from 634 to 644, Omar made
the Mohammedan empire. He had exerted great
influence over Mohammed himself; he had been most
powerful with Abu Bekr, who pointed him out for
a successor. The man who had been of violent temper
and bloody battles, now sedulously practised the administration
of justice. He gave much, and used little
for himself. He wore a patched dress, and fed on barley
bread and water; he prayed and preached, and ate and
slept upon the steps of the mosque among the pilgrims.
There he received the messengers of kings. The severe
chalif, a sworn foe to all effeminacy, strove to train a
rude host to war. Arts he proscribed, even those of
house and ship-building. When the great city of
Modain, or Ctesiphon, was taken, he commanded the
library of the Persian kings to be thrown into the
Tigris. When some of his soldiers had put on silken
garments which they had looted in Syria, he rubbed
their faces in the mud and tore their garments in pieces.
Such was the man under whom half-armed nomad tribes
broke the armies of Heraclius, and took one after
another the cities of Syria.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But on the side of the emperor were divided counsels,
distrust, rankling enmities; Nestorian and Eutychean
heretics hating each other, and still more the sovereign
under whom they should have fought as well for a common
country as for a common faith. The fate of Syria was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
decided in a terrible battle on the banks of the Hieromax,
or Yarmuk. There, the Saracen generals, Obeidah and
Khaled, <span class="tei tei-q">“The sword of God,”</span> utterly defeated the Greek
army of 80,000 men.<a id="noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href="#note_63"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a> Obeidah wrote to the chalif
Omar: <span class="tei tei-q">“In the name of the most merciful God, I must
make thee to know that I encamped on the Yarmuk,
and Manuel was near us with a force such as the Moslem
never had a greater. But God struck down that host,
and gave us the victory out of His overflowing grace
and goodness. God has given to 4030 Moslim the
honour of martyrdom. All that fled into the desert and
mountains we have put down; have beset all roads and
passes; God has made us lords of their lands and riches
and children. Written after the victory from Damaskus
where I am, and await thy command for the division of
the booty. Farewell, and the blessing and grace of
God be over thee and all Moslim.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After this, city upon city surrendered in affright. In
the winter of 636, Obeidah lay before Jerusalem, from
which Heraclius took away the Holy Cross with himself
to Constantinople. At Antioch, in his dismay, he asked
the question why those miserable half naked barbarians,
the Arabs, not to be compared with the Romans
in armour, or art of war, beat them in the field. A
veteran answered him that the wrath of God was on the
Romans, who despised His commands, were guilty of
every excess, allowed themselves intolerable oppression
and violence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We do not read that Heraclius made an attempt to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
relieve Jerusalem, which yet was besieged during a year.
Obeidah wrote to the patriarch and the inhabitants:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Salutation and blessing to all those who walk in the
right way. We invite you to confess that there is only
one God, and Mohammed is His Prophet. If you will
not make this confession, then resolve to make your
city tributary to the chalif. If you delay to do this, I
will set my people upon you, who all love death more
than you love wine and swine flesh. Hope not that I
will draw away hence, until, if God please, I have killed
all your warriors, and made slaves of your children.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The patriarch Sophronius negotiated without hope of
earthly aid, and Obeidah, to save the Holy City, the
cradle of prophets, from being desecrated by blood-shedding,
yielded to the Christian wish that the chalif
in person should be asked to receive the keys of the
city, and regulate the conditions of surrender. And in
637 Chalif Omar came from Medina. As the Commander
of the Faithful entered the city, he rode on a
camel, clothed like the poorest Bedouin, and carrying on
the same rough beast a sack of dates, rice, and bruised
wheat or maize, also a water-skin, and a large wooden
platter, on which he took his food with his companions.
The terms of capitulation which he granted to the
patriarch remained for long a standard to the Moslem
in the like cases. First of all was the poll tax imposed
by the Koran. The inhabitants to be protected and
secured in life and property; their churches not to be
pulled down, nor used by any but themselves. The
Christians duly to pay tribute; to build no new churches
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
either in the city or country; not to prevent Moslim
by night or day from entering the churches. Their
doors to be always open to travellers. The Christian to
whom a traveller comes, shall entertain him three days
gratis. Christians shall say nothing against the Koran.
Shall prevent no one becoming Moslem. Shall show
honour to Moslim. Shall not wear garments, or shoes,
or turbans, like theirs. Shall not divide their hair like
them. Shall not bear surnames like them. Shall not
ride on saddles. Shall bear no arms, nor Arabic writing
on their seals, nor give away wine, nor sell it. They
shall wear the same kind of dress everywhere, and that
with a girdle. They may have no slave who has served
a Moslem. No crosses on the churches; nor ring bells,
but only strike them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The chalif Omar caused himself to be led into all the
holy places in the garb of a pilgrim by the patriarch
Sophronius, even to the church of the Resurrection.
There he placed himself on the floor, and the patriarch
was most anxious lest he should practise his own acts of
devotion there. With breaking heart the patriarch
quoted to those around him the words of Daniel, <span class="tei tei-q">“The
abomination of desolation in the temple”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Twelve hundred and fifty years have borne witness
to the truth of that sorrowful word, and still, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
desolation continues even to the end,”</span><a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64" href="#note_64"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a> and the soldier
of the false prophet keeps order among Christians before
the sepulchre of their Lord.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hardly could the chalif Omar be induced to put off
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his rough garment long enough for it to be washed, and
to take another. But when the time of Moslem prayer
came, he would not say it in the church, lest the Moslim
should seize a church in which their chalif had prayed,
but he went to the steps of the eastern portion of
Constantine's church and prayed there. He resolved to
build a mosque on the spot where Jacob had seen in
vision the ladder, or on which the temple of Solomon
stood. He gave a hand himself to sweep away the
rubbish from it. The structure, built in haste, disappeared
suddenly. Theophanes relates that Omar was
much confused at the disappearance of his new mosque.
Some Jewish teachers came to him and said that the
structure would only remain if the cross on Mount
Calvary, not that on the Mount of Olives, were
removed. Omar did what these men suggested. Some
of his fanatics, in spite of the compact, broke all the
public crosses, destroyed holy images, attacked various
churches and chapels. He gave a special writing to
protect the church at Bethlehem wherein he had prayed,
but the Moslim afterwards took possession of this
church and of the portico at Jerusalem, and made them
mosques.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Omar returned to Medina. His armies received
command to take Ctesiphon, Aleppo, Antioch. In the
summer of 638, Heraclius retired from Antioch to
Constantinople, and as he left, says Abulfeda, cried
out, <span class="tei tei-q">“Farewell, Syria, farewell for ever”</span>. When
Antioch in August, 638, surrendered, Mesopotamia as
well as Syria fell into the hands of Omar, and all
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Roman land up to the Taurus belonged to the chalif, no
imperial force could meet him any longer in the field.
Egypt and Persia were open to him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was the year when Heraclius published the Ecthesis
at Rome. In three years more came the doom of Egypt.
Amrou was one of the most valiant and able among the
generals of Omar. He asked for leave to attack Egypt,
and meanwhile marched to its borders. When the
chalif's answer came, he first passed the borders, and
then opened it. He found written, <span class="tei tei-q">“If this letter
reaches thee before thou treadest the soil of Egypt, go
back; if thou art already on it, go forward”</span>. Amrou
went on. Battles he fought, especially at Babylon, near
Cairo. But the Copts throughout helped him, and the
Greek forces were beaten.<a id="noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href="#note_65"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a>
Amrou had travelled as a
merchant in Egypt, and knew the dispositions of its
inhabitants, and that the vast majority were so fervent
in the Eutychean heresy that they were inclined to look
with favour on the new Mohammedan unity of the Godhead,
rather than to defend their country against the
Saracenic invasion for the good of the hated Melchites,
and their emperor at Constantinople. Omar sent Amrou
a reinforcement of 12,000 men, and the Copts, being
monophysites, made peace with the Arabs, and promised
the tribute of a moderate poll tax of two drachmas,
from which old men, women, and children, were exempt.
There are said to have been six millions to pay this tax.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To Mukankas, a Copt, the governor under Heraclius,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his spies reported the life of the Arabs in the camp of
Amrou. <span class="tei tei-q">“We were among men to whom death is
dearer than life; who trouble themselves little about
earthly greatness or worldly enjoyments. They sit
on the ground, and eat kneeling; their commander
is in no way distinguished from the rest. Especially
they do not distinguish between great and
little, nor between masters and slaves. When the
time of prayer comes, no one remains behind. Each
washes himself and prays with the deepest devotion.”</span>
To the reproaches of Heraclius his governor, Mukankas,
answered: <span class="tei tei-q">“It is true the foe is not near so numerous as
we are, but one Mussulman outweighs a hundred of us.
They yearn after martyrdom, since it leads to paradise,
but we hang upon life and its joys, and fear death.”</span> The
Copts in general accepted the terms made by Mukankas;
the Greeks did not. At length Amrou, after four engagements,
in which the Copts assisted him with provisions
and the building of bridges, advanced upon
Alexandria, whither the Greeks had retired.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alexandria is said to have been besieged during fourteen
months, and to have cost the lives of 23,000 Arabs.
It was never cut off by sea from assistance. The Arabs
had neither besieging engines nor a fleet. But Heraclius,
who was dying of dropsy, instead of sending a fleet to
save the last hold which he had upon Egypt, sent a
bishop to make terms with Amrou for his retirement.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Bishop,”</span> said the Saracen leader, <span class="tei tei-q">“do you see that
obelisk? When you have swallowed it I will retire from
Alexandria.”</span> The city fell in 640, and since Omar had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the library of the Persian monarchs at Ctesiphon thrown
into the Tigris, there is no reason to doubt the fact recorded
that he fed the 4000 baths of Alexandria during
six months with the treasures of Greek literature. An
uninterrupted peace since the destruction of the
Serapeium, 240 years before, had allowed that city in
the world which was most devoted to literature and the
richest in commerce ample time to collect the greatest
of libraries. The double destruction suits exactly the
character given to Chalif Omar by Arab historians.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Amrou was not allowed, by Omar's prudence, to live
as governor of Egypt at Alexandria. Fostat—that is,
the Tent—where he had dwelt during his siege of
Babylon, developed from being the seat of his government
to the present Cairo. But to the west Amrou extended
the Saracen dominion over Barca and Tripolis.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Omar reigned ten years, a Chalif at whose words of
rebuke his strongest commanders quailed, and he ruled
a kingdom which he stretched in these ten years from
Tripolis to the Indus; from the Caspian Sea to the
Cataracts of the Nile. He destroyed the Sassanide
empire; and the sword of Mohammed, wielded by his
second chalif, cut in two the empire of Heraclius.
With the loss of Syria, Mesopotamia, and Egypt, the
successor of Constantine was reduced to shelter himself
behind the walls of Byzantium from the Saracen host,
which perpetually plundered his provinces from the
Bosphorus to Mount Taurus. During the Roman
dominion of many hundred years that vast territory had
been in climate, as Herodotus a thousand years before
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had said of it, the garden of the earth. It had, further,
been studded with cities rich in monuments of Greek
civilisation. Afterwards these came to be ruled by
bishops, many of whom descended from the preaching of
St. Peter and St. Paul. Now all this territory lived in
anguish at the thought of Moslem incursion. Only the
invention of the Greek fire, kept a secret, saved Byzantium
itself from suffering in the latter half of the seventh
century the doom which fell upon it in the fifteenth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Chalif Omar had pressed his captive provinces with
heavy tributes. A Christian artisan, who was made to
pay four drachmas a day for taxes in Kufa, journeyed to
Medina to plead for remission before Omar in person.
It was refused. He followed the chalif to the Mosque,
and dealt him, as he prayed, a deadly blow. Omar died,
having named, when mortally wounded, the six eldest
companions of the prophet to choose his successor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Heraclius died at Constantinople in 641. The chalif
Omar reigned from the death of Abu Bekr, in August,
634, to November, 644. Before him had died the most
cruel of Arabian commanders, Khaled.<a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href="#note_66"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a> He who buried
alive captive enemies murmured on his sick-bed, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
have been in so many battles, and received so many
wounds, that there is scarcely a whole place in my body;
and now I must die on a bed as an ass dies on his straw”</span>.
Jezdeberg, the last of the Sassanide princes, was hopelessly
beaten, and in 651 closed, under Mussulman extinction,
the dynasty which since 226 had renewed the
battle of Persia for empire with its old rival Rome. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
great city of Madain or Ctesiphon was destroyed, and
Mohammed, the chalif's governor in Persia planted Kufa
as a military city on the right bank of the Euphrates,
three days journey from Bagdad. Omar learnt that his
governor Mohammed had built himself a stately palace
over against the chief mosque at Kufa. This he had
adorned with a magnificent gateway taken from the
palace of Chosroes at Ctesiphon. In wrath Omar wrote:
<span class="tei tei-q">“the kings of Persia have gone down from their palaces
to hell: the Prophet rose from the dust of the earth to
heaven. I have ordered the bearer of these lines to burn
down thy palace at once, lest thou miss the way of the
Prophet for that of the corrupt Persian.”</span> The palace
was burnt. Omar knew how to destroy, and they
record of his ten years that thirty-six thousand cities,
villages, or castles were taken and wasted, and fourteen
thousand Christian churches burnt or changed into
mosques. History, I believe, has not recorded how many
thousand Christian women were delivered over as a prey
to the Arabian savages, to whom he promised paradise
as a reward for dying in battle against the unbelievers.
This was the Mohammedan martyrdom. Omar sought
to impress a holy character upon the savage deeds which
the hordes marshalled by him to victory or martyrdom
practised without scruple. In setting up the colossal
kingdom which he founded during the ten years of his
chalifate he covered the earth with heaps of slain in the
name of the most merciful God. He is said to have
established judges in the chief cities of his empire, who
should administer justice according to the written or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
traditional precepts of Mohammed. He had great care
for the security of all the lands subject to him. <span class="tei tei-q">“If,”</span> he
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“a shepherd on the banks of the Euphrates or the
Tigris have one of his sheep stolen, I fear that I shall

by Mussulmen for his great qualities as sovereign. But
he cared less to spread Islam from Arabia over all the
world than to enrich Arabia at the cost of all the world.
Foreign nations were to be put in chains, but not ennobled
and bettered. They were to encounter not
preachers, but tax-gatherers. His rulers might inflict
any oppressions on those who were not Mussulmen, provided
they sent the fruits of their oppression to him at
Medina. At the same time he fed on barley bread, and
had but one cloak for the summer and another for the
winter, both well darned. But let us turn to his family
life. Little of it is known, but that he had seven
marriages—three in Mecca, four after the exit to
Medina, one of them being with a daughter of Ali—and
that he had two slave concubines who bore him children.
Two other wives he tried to get. A daughter of Otba
refused him because he kept his wives jealously shut up.
But Asma, a daughter of Abu Bekr, disliked the barley
bread and camel's flesh of his household. He sought her
in vain by the help of Aischa. Not obtaining her, he
turned to Amm Kolthum, a daughter of Ali and Fatima,
and granddaughter of Mohammed. Ali said to him,
<span class="tei tei-q">“My daughter is too young to marry”</span>. Omar would
not believe it, upon which Ali sent his daughter to him
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in a single vestment. Omar drew back her veil, and
wished to draw her to him. But she escaped, and fled
to her father, and told him of Omar's conduct. Ali then
said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“If thou wert not chalif, I would tear out
thine eyes”</span>. But Omar sought her again before comrades
of the highest rank, grounding his proposal on
what Mohammed had once said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Every relationship
and connection ceases at the Day of Judgment, except
one contracted with me”</span>. Ali went home, and said to
his daughter: <span class="tei tei-q">“Go back to Omar”</span>. She rejoined:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Wilt thou send me again to this old voluptuary?”</span> Ali
replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“He is thy husband”</span>.<a id="noteref_68" name="noteref_68" href="#note_68"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">68</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But though in the last years of Omar Ali became his
father-in-law, no friendly relation seems ever to have
existed between them. Ali had been the first in all
Mohammed's battles; by Omar he was made neither
commander nor governor. But in Mussulman remembrance
Omar stands as the greatest of their rulers,
because of the vast power and extension to which under
him Islam attained.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us see what Omar in his chalifate did to Constantine's
empire and the Christian faith.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When in 610 Heraclius was drawn from his father's
governorship of Northern Africa to end the cruelties of
Phocas, the great mass of the eastern empire still stood,
threatened indeed by Avar Chagans on the north, and
by the restless Persian empire on the east. But the
whole coast of Northern Africa, Egypt and Syria, the
realm from Antioch to the end of the Euxine on the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
east, and to Stamboul on the west, as well as the great
country south of the Danube, stretching from the Euxine
to the Adriatic and down to the south of the Morea,
each of which last would make by itself a noble monarchy,
remained intact, and if the eastern despot held his head
a little lower than Justinian's head had been held, it
needed still but a Constantine or a Theodosius to breathe
conquering force as well as maintaining power into that
vast body which still called itself Roman. Instead of a
true life and a royal will directing that life it had nothing
but Greek arts wielded by Oriental despotism. In ten
years the sons of the desert, half clothed and fed on
barley bread, invoking the God of Mohammed, discomfited
the disciplined hosts of the Lord of the world,
and carried into dishonour and apostacy the women and
children of great provinces. Egypt since the battle of
Actium had been the most carefully-guarded province of
Augustus and the emperors who came after him. It
ceased at once and for ever to be Roman. Not only
was there a change in the civil power, but its six
millions of Monophysites preferred the crescent under
Amrou, as Omar's lieutenant, to the cross enthroned with
Heraclius at Constantinople. Antioch ceased to be
Roman, and with it Syria and Mesopotamia. Beyond
these the vast regions of Persia fell into the hands of
Omar, and were ruled for the present from an Arab city
Medina, unknown till then beyond Arabian limits.
The outposts of Omar were at Mount Taurus, looking
thence with desire over the vast historic region sprinkled
with stately cities up to the banks of the Bosphorus.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
These immense regions were lost suddenly but they
were also lost permanently. In ten years they were
forfeited by possessors who had held them for seven
hundred, and after twelve centuries and a half they
remain in the hands of the false religion which took them
by force and keeps them against recovery by Christians.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Wonderful besides the suddenness of the stroke was
the inadequacy of the instrument to the effect produced,
the blindness of the time before the coming revolution.
Neither St. Gregory among the saints one generation
only before it came, nor Heraclius returning a conqueror
over the Great King within ten years of the Saracenic
catastrophe, anticipated that there were southern hordes
extreme in ignorance, devoid of art, and without political
sense or experience, but lying in the hand of Providence
to take possession of lands with ancient culture and a
thousand years of civilised history. St. Gregory indeed
had witnessed himself such ruin, and followed two
centuries of such disasters, which had stripped Italy of
her crown of cities, that he thought the world itself was
coming to an end. But the establishment of a great
southern empire, founded by vagrant tribes till then
known only as robbers, never presented itself to his
mind. That they would go forth and conquer with a
new war-cry, directed especially against the Cross of
Christ, was as little in his thoughts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By the year of Omar's death there was a new empire
ruled by a man from an unknown Arabian town, in the
name of a man who had died twelve years before, and
claimed to be a prophet, the special herald of one God.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
In the belief thus set up, it was no other than this God
who had invested not the prophet only, but the chalifs
who came after him with supreme power, not civil only,
but religious, and supreme simply because it was
religious, and exercised in the name of this new God.
And the empire so set up included already the vast
dominions of the Great King, and fully one half of the
empire which Justinian had left.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But greater yet was the difference which separated
this empire from all that had preceded it. Omar ruled
with absolute power as chalif of Mohammed, whose
right to power of any kind, civil or religious, lay only
in his office of prophet. The Roman emperor ruled
because he was lord of a subject-confederacy of nations,
which the Roman arm and the Roman mind had, bit by
bit, subdued and wrought together, and which, when so
constituted, had been deposited entire by secular warranty
in his single hand. But Mohammed ruled, and
after him the chalifs, because he was <span class="tei tei-q">“the Apostle of
God,”</span> by a divine commission, whole and entire, from
which civil and religious authority equally emanated,
but in which the religious was the root of the civil.
Such was the power which the companions of Mohammed
in the first election of Abu Bekr, launched upon
the world, and which, as second chalif, Omar received.
And in the spirit of this, he ruled the huge empire of
conquest, which stretched from the African Tripolis to
the end of Persia, and from the southernmost point of
Egypt to the Cilician Taurus, engulphing Alexandria,
Antioch, and Jerusalem. No portion of this power did
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Omar wield without assuming to represent the person
who made himself, or was made by others, his followers,
the last and highest of the prophets; who was willing
indeed to acknowledge Jesus, the Son of Mary, in the
number of prophets, but only on the condition that the
prophetical list was closed in himself, that it pointed to
himself, and was crowned in himself. The Mohammedan
war-cry, to die for which was to be a martyr, <span class="tei tei-q">“There is
no God but God, and Mohammed is his prophet,”</span>
was at once the denial of the Christian Trinity, and of
Christ's Redeemership. All those who bore it, fought
for it, died for it, proclaimed an absolute hostility to the
Christian faith, and a definite substitution of another
faith for it, and another person on whom that faith
rested. This was the empire personified in Omar; and
this, in the ten years from 634 to 644, seized upon the
southern half of what had been the inheritance
bequeathed by Constantine to his successors. The new
realm was ruled by Omar with singleness of purpose
and unbending resolution to make the Mohammedan
standard victorious over the cross, to dethrone Christ
for Mohammed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Was the blow to the empire equally a blow to the
Church? The severance of provinces so vast, so populous,
so rich in natural productions, from Heraclius, was
in itself depriving the lord of the world of legs and
arms; but more dangerous than any material privation
was the setting up an empire with a definite creed, in
which religious conquest was by far the most powerful
ingredient. The war-cry, <span class="tei tei-q">“There is no God but God,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Mohammed is his prophet,”</span> meant the earth and all
that is in it, its fruits, and above all, its women, belong
entirely to the followers of Mohammed. They who do
not either become his, or pay tribute to him, have no
rights. Their children become slaves, their wives and
daughters captive. These begin to be the absolute
possession of the Mohammedan conqueror; if he dies
in battle, rewards of martyrdom, so won, for his
successors: if he lives, adornments of his life, which he
pleases God by accepting.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As to the treatment of Christian countries, Omar, in
the capture of Jerusalem, had supplied a rule and
standard which for the present was followed at least
in profession. Christians were not treated as idolaters:
they were taken into covenant. We are told that the
tribute was so moderate that the first Egyptians and
Syrians who accepted it, thought that they had made a
favourable transfer of themselves from Byzantine to
Mohammedan lordship.<a id="noteref_69" name="noteref_69" href="#note_69"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">69</span></span></a> The Byzantine had perpetually
interfered with their religious convictions, and domineered
over their ecclesiastical appointments. Mohammedans,
in the disdain of superior power resting on
their exclusive possession of truth, kept entirely aloof.
Once their own lordship established and acknowledged,
they allowed their subjects a certain freedom of action
within the lines of Omar's covenant. It is probable
that they began by so doing, nor is it easy to account
for the rapid and continued submission of provinces,
such as Syria and Egypt, without the willingness of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their inhabitants to accept the change be taken into
account. But it is certain that the Christian religion
drooped more and more under the shadow of Mohammedan
domination.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Antioch fell under it in 637. From that time forth,
the so-called patriarch began often to live at Byzantium.
The patriarchate, which, down to the heresies of the
third and fourth centuries, had probably, in Christian
population, in learning, in the distinction which its
bishops enjoyed each in their own city, been the most
flourishing portion of the Church, began to decline.
The deposition of St. Eustathius, in 330, cost its capital
a schism of nearly a hundred years. The partisanship
of its patriarch with its countryman, Nestorius, prejudiced
both its rank and its unity. What proportion of
its once eleven provinces and 161 bishops belonged to it
at the time of the Mohammedan invasion might be
difficult to ascertain. But how great and wide its
circuit was is shown by the instance of Theodoret,
bishop of Cyrrhus, which, though an undistinguished
see, contained in it no less than eight hundred parishes,<a id="noteref_70" name="noteref_70" href="#note_70"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">70</span></span></a>
and was under Hierapolis, as seat of the Metropolitan.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After 638, the Antiochene patriarch never more
lifted his diminished head as the holder of one of the
three great Petrine Sees, whom St. Innocent I. and St.
Gregory I. had acknowledged with themselves as representatives
of St. Peter.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In all this, we behold the consummation of a fearful
history, and I will take the words of one who witnessed the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
northern wandering of the nations to illustrate, rather
perhaps, to account for, the much more terrible wandering
of the nations in the south. It was more than two
hundred and forty years before this new kingdom
arose that St. Jerome, from his solitude at Bethlehem,
addressed a friend. It was in the year immediately
succeeding the death of the great Theodosius. His
rapid view of the generation which had just passed
will inspire many thoughts. He is consoling the
bishop, Heliodorus, for the loss of his nephew, the
priest, Nepotian, a dear friend of his own: <span class="tei tei-q">“and why,”</span>
he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“am I trying to heal a wound which time
and thought, as I believe, have already soothed?
Why do I not rather bring before you the miseries of
royalty so near to us? Our time has such calamities
that it were well not so much to mourn one on whom
this light has ceased to shine as to congratulate the
escape from such misfortunes. Constantius, the
patron of the Arian heresy, in the midst of preparing
for the enemy's onset, and rushing to the fight, dies
in the village of Mopsis, and, in great sorrow, left his
empire a prey to his foe. Julian, betrayer of his
own life, and slaughterer of an army that was
Christian, acknowledged in Media the power of that
Christ whom he had first denied in Gaul. Striving
to extend the Roman frontiers, he lost what they had
already gained. Jovian had but a taste of imperial
power, and died suffocated by charcoal fumes: an
instance to all men of what human dominion is.
Valentinian laid waste his own native land, and,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
leaving it unavenged, broke a blood-vessel and died.
His brother, Valens, in the war with the Goths, was defeated
in Thrace, and found a tomb on the spot of his
death. Gratian, betrayed by his own army, and not
received by the cities which he approached, suffered
the mockery of enemies: and thy walls, O Lyons,
bear the impression of the blood-stained hand. The
young Valentinian, scarcely beyond boyhood, after
flight, after banishment, after recovering the empire
with great blood-shedding, was slain near the city,
guilty of his brother's death: and his lifeless body
suffered the ignominy of the halter. Then there was
Procopius, and Maximus, and Eugenius, who, when
they were in power, struck their opponents with
terror. All stood captives before their conquerors:
and suffered that utmost misery of those once powerful:
to be reduced to slavery, and then slaughtered.</span>

For, indeed, the time was come, through the extraordinary
wickedness of two hundred years, when the
very sanctuaries from which St. Jerome was writing, the
sanctuaries of the birth and death of Christ, Bethlehem
and Calvary, were to fall, not by a sudden inroad, but a
permanent occupation into the hands of His chief
enemies. The time was also come when the see of the
great confessor whose name we identify with the battle
of faith against the world, the see of Athanasius himself,
the Pope of the East, the next in hierarchical order to
the Universal Pope, was to fall, and to fall for ever, from
its high estate. <span class="tei tei-q">“Almost from the death of Athanasius

patriarchates, as distinct wholes, almost disappear from

which they had been even from the time of the Arian
heresy.<a id="noteref_73" name="noteref_73" href="#note_73"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a> The declension of Antioch had been of as long
standing as the declension of Alexandria. At the end
of the fourth century St. Chrysostom bore witness to its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hundred thousand Christians. But in the course of the
fifth the great third see of the Church lost much of its
reputation and power. Partly it fell into weak hands,
as John I., from 428 to 441, who held but a poor position
in the Nestorian conflict, while Domnus II. took
part in the robber council of 447. Then, at Chalcedon,
the elevation of Jerusalem to a patriarchate took from
its jurisdiction the three Palestines. But especially the
encroachments of the see of Byzantium told upon it.
The bishops of the royal city claimed to consecrate the
already-named patriarchs. Anatolius ordained Maximus,
who was substituted for Domnus II. when deposed in
spite of his subservience to Dioscorus. In this he disregarded
the rights of the bishops of the Antiochene
patriarchate, and the Byzantine bishops forthwith
turned that precedent into a right. Maximus was followed
by Basilius, Acacius, and Martyrius. The Monophysite
Peter Fullo formed such a party against the last
that he resigned in despair. This usurper resisted the
Emperor Zeno's condemnation to banishment, and
put himself, first secretly, then openly, as patriarch
against Julian. He so persecuted the Catholics, that
Julian died of sorrow. The Emperor Zeno banished the
heretical Peter Fullo to Pityuns. He was succeeded by
the equally heretical John II., Kodonatus. But this
patriarch was deposed in three months by the exertion
of the bishops. The Monophysites already prevailed.
They murdered in the sacred place itself the new
Catholic patriarch, Stephen II., and threw his mangled
body into the Orontes. The emperor punished the crime,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Acacius, Bishop of Constantinople, put in his place
Stephen III. Pope Simplicius censured this violation of
the canons, and prohibited it for the future, which did
not prevent Acacius renewing his encroachments when,
after the death of Stephen in 482, he consecrated
Colendion. Colendion was afterwards banished by the
Emperor Zeno, and had to yield to the old heresiarch,
Peter Fullo, who kept his patriarchate to his death in 488,
and was succeeded by the equally heretical Palladius.
Almost all Syria rose against the Catholic patriarch
Flavian; the monk Severus got hold of the patriarchate,
and kept it for six years. He fled in 519, under the
Emperor Justin I., to Egypt. His successors, Paul II.,
who resigned in 521 through fear of an accusation, and
Euphrasius of Jerusalem, could no longer secure
superiority to the Catholics. Patriarch Ephrem followed
from 526 to 545. He held a Synod against Origenism.
Patriarch Domnus III. took part in the Fifth Council in
553. He was followed by the distinguished Anastasius
I., and after St. Gregory I. by Anastasius II. The See
remained a long time vacant. Those who then followed,
Athanasius, Macedonius, and Macarius, were Monothelites.
The two latter from the time the Saracens took Antioch,
in 637, resided in Constantinople for safety. After
George, who is said to have subscribed the Trullan Council
in 692, the See was vacant forty years, and the patriarchs
had often to endure extortions, ill-treatment, and banishment.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
facts. Under the violent Dioscorus the see of St. Mark
not only declined from its distinction when ruled by St.
Cyril, but threw the whole of Egypt into wild confusion
by espousing the Monophysite error. The Catholic
patriarch, Proterius, was murdered in 457: and the
heretical Timotheus Ailouros set up by his party
instead. He, though condemned by the emperor, Leo
I., to banishment, maintained himself stubbornly
against the Catholic patriarch, Solophakialos. After his
death, Peter Mongus was able to expel the Catholic,
John Talaia: and then, from 490 to 538, Alexandria
had a succession of five Monophysite patriarchs. Under
Justinian, from 538, during forty years, we find four
Catholic patriarchs. So, again, in Eulogius, the friend
of St. Gregory, and John the alms-giver. But during
this time the Monophysites also had their patriarchal
succession, and that even from different sects of the
heresy. The end of it was that the bitterest enmity
arose between the Melchite or Royalist, and the Monophysite
party. The former, being a small minority,
held by favour of the Byzantine emperor and his troops
in Egypt the possession of authority. The Copts, being
a great majority, considered themselves oppressed, and
welcomed as deliverers, in 638, the conquering Arabs.
The Melchite party sunk so low that their patriarchal
place was vacant during eighty years, and the number
of their bishops greatly sank. After 750, the Christian
inhabitants of Egypt were more and more exposed to
Mohammedan brutality. Sharp laws against them were
issued: distinguishing marks and clothes prescribed.

And here not only is the fall of the three patriarchates
under conquerors who strive to destroy the Christian
faith to be noted as following upon two centuries of
incessant heresy, but another divine judgment also. No
sooner have the three patriarchs lost their original
position, the two elder as second and third bishops of the
whole Church in virtue of their descent from Peter,
and taken definitively a position subordinate to the
upstart at Byzantium, who in the last decade of the
fifth century, in the time of Pope Gelasius, was proclaimed
in his Council at Rome no patriarch at all, than
they fall under a domination which is not merely infidel
but antichristian. The aim of the chalifate is to supplant
Christ by Mohammed. The patriarchs, who accepted as
superior one who rose above them simply because he
was bishop of the imperial residence, had from that
time forward to live under a despot who reigned in the
name of the false prophet. From being subjects of the
Greek Basileus, who, by means of the bishop exalted by
him in successive generations, strove to hamper in the
exercise of his office the successor of St. Peter, even to
the point of making him subject to the guidance of the
Byzantine crown in spiritual matters, which was the
meaning of the Ecthesis of Heraclius, they passed to be
subjects of the Mohammedan chalif, who claimed the
supremacy of both powers in the name of the falsehood
just invented.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the diminished territory of Byzantium, which
during the rest of the century after Heraclius could but
just keep the Mohammedan conqueror outside its walls,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the bishop of the royal residence became in fact the sole
patriarch. Sergius and Pyrrhus, Paul and Peter, the first
four of those so exalted, were branded as heretics by the
Sixth Council. Those who still bore the names of
Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem appeared at times, or
were deemed to appear, at a Byzantine Council, but the
hundred bishops of the Alexandrine, and the hundred
and sixty bishops of the Antiochene waned and wasted
more and more with every generation miserably spent
under the absolute rule of the Prophet's chalif, who had
for Christians only two modes of treatment, the one a
noxious patronage of their heresy, if such prevailed; the
other, persecution of their faith, if they were faithful
and zealous.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the accession of St. Athanasius to the See of
Alexandria in 328 to the placing Cyrus in that See by
Heraclius in 628, exactly three centuries elapse. In this
time the great revolution begun by Constantine, when he
took for his counsellor the court-bishop Eusebius, has
full space to work itself out. His own son, Constantius,
<span class="tei tei-q">“patron of the Arian heresy,”</span> in St. Jerome's words,
inaugurates in full force the attempt of the Byzantine
monarchs to extend their temporal power over the
spiritual. Valens so persecutes the eastern Church that
when Theodosius is called in to save the empire, he
finds the eastern episcopate in the state of ruin described
by St. Basil. Unfortunately, he saw no better
means of restoring it, when, in 381, he invited the
bishops of his empire to anxious deliberation, than by
laying the first stone of the Byzantine bishop's exaltation.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
An eastern Council, at his prompting, strives to
make that bishop the second bishop of the whole
Church on a false foundation, because Constantinople is
Nova Roma. Every Byzantine monarch adds his stone
to the Byzantine bishop's pillar of pride. St. Leo exposes
and censures the assumption. Pope Gelasius
does not reckon him among the patriarchs. Justinian
enacts him to be ecumenical patriarch, which St.
Gregory pronounces to be a title of diabolical pride:
being, in fact, the building of spiritual power on temporal
lordship. In thirty years after St. Gregory, the
act of pride denounced by him receives its full interpretation.
The patriarch Sergius attempts to mould the
doctrine of the Church under the authority of Constantine's
successor: and Constantine's empire is cut in half
by the chalif of the man who claims all temporal
power on the pretence that he has been invested by
God with spiritual power. And two conflicting heresies,
the Nestorian and Eutychean, the latter making its last
development in the Monothelite, have severed the eastern
empire into rivalities so bitter, that the Christians
of the several parties hate each other more than they
hate the new Mohammedan pretender. The episcopate,
seen in all its glory and grandeur when first assembled
by Constantine in 325, sinks ingloriously under the successors,
in Alexandria and Antioch, of the very prelates
who maintained the faith at Nicæa: sinks before Mohammed,
who is seen to complete the work of Arius.
The successor of St. Peter has done his utmost during
two hundred years to preserve the eastern sees of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Peter: and in them the whole ecclesiastical constitution
formed for herself by the Church in the ten generations
preceding Constantine: but Alexandria and Antioch
have no prerogative of infallibility: they perish by
their own folly: heresy pollutes their sees for generations,
and at last the false prophet's chalif alternately
blights them with the favour which he shows to their
heresy, or wastes them with the oppression which he
has always ready for the faith. As to the great eastern
patriarchate, from its capture by the Saracens in 638,
its host of bishops, at the head of Hellenic cities descending
from Alexander's empire, becomes, sooner or later,
the prey of the Moslem. From the capture of Alexandria,
Egypt becomes Monophysite under what the Copts
fancy to be protection from the chalif, with the ultimate
result that the country of the desert Fathers becomes
the heart of the religion denying Christ: and,
with Omar's entry into Jerusalem, upon his rough
camel, with his wooden platter and his bag of barley,
begin the 1260 years of the Holy City's treading down
by the Gentiles.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus the southern wandering of the nations came
upon the northern. When it came, three hundred
years of such times as St. Jerome saw and described
had already spread over the earth, sufferings too
great for words, changes, as he says, such as neither
Thucydides nor Sallust could express. But the
southern wandering was much more rapid in time,
and in effect far more complete. The ten years of
Omar's chalifate had changed the whole aspect of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the world, had shifted the centre of political power.
It had been at Constantinople: it was shifted to
Medina. From Constantine to Heraclius the empire
had taken and enrolled in its armies unnumbered
men of Teuton race. Alaric had been a Roman
general: Stilicho and Aetius, saviours of Rome.
This race had also fed the Church with converts of
more stalwart nature than the enfeebled races who
needed the infusion of northern blood even to till
their fields, as well as to guard their frontiers, or to
guide their polity. But the southern wandering
gave no soldiers to the empire, and no converts to
the Church. There would be no greater contrast
than the two races from which these two great movements
came. The northern barbarian, with all his
wildness, could take the impress of the Church. He
had in his woods and marshes, in his transmigrations
and encampments, kept, in no small degree, the
original tradition of the human race. Already Tacitus
had noted his regard for woman as the companion
of his life, for the sanctity of marriage, for monogamy,
in the practical guarding of which he put to
shame the degenerate Roman, and still more corrupted
Greek. The heroic courage, natural to him,
was an omen of the point which, as Christian martyr,
he might reach. The self-government shown in the
original habits of the tribe was a soil whereon princes
and bishops might sit in council to form governments
in which <span class="tei tei-q">“liberty and empire,”</span> unknown to Byzantine,
might dwell together. These qualities were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
elements of the social, the political, even the ecclesiastical
life. Far otherwise was the Saracen type.
Savage, rude and ignorant, with no tincture of art
or learning: with habits of unlimited polygamy:
with leanings to unmitigated despotism: with no
regard to human life. In courage only was the
southern a match for the northern barbarian. The
outcome of his whole character as to the rest was
different: and the religion invented for him was
but the barest development of his natural temperament.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the death of Chalif Omar, this new antichristian
power had taken from the empire of Heraclius every
yard of land formerly under its dominion from
Tarsus to Tripoli: and stood in most threatening
attitude over against all which remained to it: indeed,
to the whole Christian name. Mohammed was
its watchword against Christ. The northern wandering
had no such counter watchword. It respected
Roman laws and customs when it seized on Roman
lands. It had understanding enough, not only as
shown in its princes, Ataulph and Theodorich, but in
a race of officers surpassing not only Roman courage,
but Roman fidelity in the civil and military administration,
to venerate as unapproachable by any wisdom
of its own, the political fabric of which, in so many
lands, it confiscated the resources.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But Omar's treatment of Greek learning in the
library of Alexandria was the expression of his whole
mind towards Christian civilisation. And Omar's
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
powerful hand had not only maimed Byzantium, but
absorbed Persia. All this had been done since Heraclius
carried back the Cross in triumph to Jerusalem.
The Persian had kept it in its shrine during its captivity
with the seals untouched. The Saracen scorned all
which it represented. The contest of those whom
Heraclius would leave in his place was to be with the
Saracens, Omar, Osman, and Ali.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After the Chalif Omar was mortally wounded in
the mosque at Medina, he at first named Abd Errahman
for his successor, who declined the chalifate.
Whereupon Omar named six of Mohammed's companions,
together with the same Abd Errahman to
choose a new chalif. They were engaged during three
days in heated contest, since each of the six wished to
become the chalif, and were at last induced with great
difficulty by Abd Errahman to accept one of their number
named by him. Thus Osman, at the age of seventy,
was chosen as successor of Omar. His chalifate lasted
from November, 644, to June, 656: during the whole
of which, eleven years and a-half, the Saracen realm
was disturbed by internal struggles. Yet external wars
continued. Governors, appointed by Osman, were decried,
but they did many successful deeds of arms.<a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href="#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a> In
North Africa, the boundaries of the realm were extended
on from Tripolis as far as Kairawan. In Persia,
a governor, afterwards removed, gained a province.
The whole of Persia, which had been overrun rather
than subdued under Omar, was finally conquered under
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Osman. An attempt of the Greeks to recover Alexandria
and Egypt succeeded for a moment, but was
frustrated by the aid given to the Moslim by the Monophysite
Copts. Parts of Armenia and Asia Minor were
taken, and the island of Cyprus. The Moslim carried
their conquering arms to the Oxus, and slew, in his retreat
from a lost battle, the last heir of the kings of
Persia.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In 656, the discontents produced by Osman's favour
of his own family culminated in an insurrection at
Medina, in which the dwelling of the chalif, after a
siege of several weeks, was at last broken open, and
the third Commander of the Faithful, also, like Ali, a
son-in-law of Mohammed, was slain by the eldest son
of Abu Bekr, the first chalif. A week after his death,
the third chalif, Osman, was succeeded by Ali, the
fourth, widower of Mohammed's favourite daughter,
Fatima. But the six and a-half years of Ali's chalifate
were occupied with a violent struggle between him and
Muawiah, cousin of Osman, and governor of Syria.<a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href="#note_75"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a>
There had ever been enmity between the family of
Haschim, from which Mohammed descended, and the
family of Abd Schems, from which Osman and Muawiah
descended. In the course of the struggle Egypt fell
away from Ali to Muawiah; and, in 660, Medina and
Mecca paid him homage. Ali's power, then, was seated
only in Irak and Persia. Civil war pressed so heavily
on Islam that three men resolved to rid it in one day
of Ali, Muawiah, and Amrou, as the causers of all the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
trouble. Ali was to be assassinated in the mosque of
Kufa; Muawiah in that of Damascus; Amrou in that of
Fostat, to terminate a war carried on, not only in the
field, but by mutual imprecations from the pulpit. But
of the three, Ali alone was mortally wounded, Muawiah
escaped with a light wound, and Amrou's representative
was killed instead of him. Ali died, three days after,
on the 24th January, 661. He is said to have surpassed
not only Muawiah, but Abu Bekr and Omar in abhorrence
of all falsehood, in love of justice, in valour and
eloquence. In simplicity of life and generosity, Ali resembled
his two predecessors: but, like them also, the
severity which he practised by no means included moral
restraint. He died at sixty-three; after Fatima's death,
and, therefore, in the latter half of his life, he contracted
six or eight marriages, besides maintaining nineteen
slave women, with whom also, after the custom of that
time, he lived.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So the second, third, and fourth chalifs—Omar,
Osman, and Ali—perished by assassination within seventeen
years of each other, in 644, 656, and 661. Let us
turn to see what has been doing at Constantinople in
these seventeen years. We have already seen how
Omar, in his ten years, had built up an empire from
the spoils of Byzantium and Persia, which, during the
civil wars of his two successors, was yet increased. The
seat of its sovereign power was transferred from Medina
to Damascus as soon as Muawiah was acknowledged as
chalif, in the year 661. But during the four chalifs,
from the death of Mohammed in 632 to 660, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
immense Mohammedan realm was governed from
Medina.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When Heraclius died in 641, he was covered with
defeat, and the chief provinces of his empire were, day
by day, falling away. He left a son, Constantine,
twenty-eight years old, who had been named emperor
from his birth: and, by his second marriage with his
niece, Martina, a son, Heracleonas, nineteen years old,
who had been named emperor two years before, and
two younger sons, David and Marinus, named Cæsars,
besides two daughters, who, like their mother, had been
named expresses. In his will he directed his two sons,
Constantine and Heracleonas, to reign together with
equal power, and to acknowledge Martina as empress-mother.
Constantine III. was not Monothelite, but
orthodox. At his accession he received a letter<a id="noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href="#note_76"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a> from
Pope John IV., maintaining the true doctrine, and also
that his predecessor, Honorius, answering a question
put to him by the patriarch Sergius, <span class="tei tei-q">“taught concerning
the mystery of the Incarnation, that there were not
in Christ, as in us sinners, opposing wills of the mind
and the flesh: and for this, certain persons, trusting to their
own meaning, threw out the suspicion that he had taught
there to be the only one will of the Godhead and the
Manhood, which is altogether contrary to the truth”</span>.
This the Pope proceeds to prove at length. And he
ends by saying that he finds a certain document, contrary
to Pope Leo, of blessed memory, and the Council
of Chalcedon, has been issued, to which bishops are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
compelled to subscribe. This was the Ecthesis of
Heraclius. And he entreats the new emperor, as
guardian of the Christian faith, to command this document
to be torn down, and, as a first sacrifice to God, to
scatter from His Church every cloud of novelty. So, if
he regard the things of God, may the Lord, whose faith
is preserved in purity, preserve his empire from the
nations trusting in their ferocity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the emperor, Constantine III., died 103 days
after his father, poisoned, as eastern historians say, by
his step-mother, the empress Martina: with which
crime they also inculpate the patriarch Pyrrhus. She
then reigned with her son, Heracleonas; but not for
long. An insurrection deposed her: both she and Heracleonas
were maimed and banished, and Constans II.,
son of Constantine III., and grandson of Heraclius, at
twelve years old became emperor, under tutelage of
the council. The answer given to the letter of Pope
John IV. was that the Ecthesis affixed to the door of
churches should be removed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the empire was torn to pieces by the strife of the
various heresies contending for mastery. The patriarch
Pyrrhus, who had succeeded Sergius in the see of Constantinople,
and in the patronage of his heresy, found it
expedient on the deposition of Martina to leave his see.
He appeared in Africa, and had a great controversy
with Maximus in the presence of the African episcopate
in 645. He acknowledged himself to be defeated: and
went to Pope Theodorus at Rome, where he renounced
the Monothelite heresy, and was received by the Pope
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as bishop of the capital. But he returned presently, at
the instance of the exarch of Ravenna, to the errors
which he had renounced.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In due time the emperor, Constans II., produced the
Typus to take the place of his grandfather's Ecthesis.
And, when Pope St. Martin held his great Council at
Rome in 649, Constans burst into fury, and, as above
recorded, afterwards caused the Pope to be kidnapped,
to be tried at Constantinople, and to be condemned for
high treason; finally, to perish of want in the Crimea.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With Pope St. Martin, Maximus had been the great
defender of the faith. It is time to give some record
of his life, his labours, and his reward.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Maximus sprung about the year 580 at Constantinople
from an old and noble family. There were few of rank
superior to his relations. He had great abilities, received
an excellent education, and became one of the
most learned men in his time, and the ablest theologian.
The emperor Heraclius drew him against his wishes to
the court, and made him one of his chief secretaries.
But, in the year 630, his love for solitude, as well as
his observance of the wrong bias which the mind of
Heraclius was taking, led him to withdraw from court.
He resigned the brilliant position which he occupied,
became a monk in the monastery of Chrysopolis, that
is, Scutari, and, on the death of its abbot, was chosen
unanimously to succeed him. Henceforth to the end of
his life, at the age of eighty-two, he became, by word
and deed, a champion of the Catholic faith against the
Monothelite heresy. In 633, he went with Sophronius,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
then a simple monk, to Alexandria, and joined him in
entreating the patriarch, Cyrus, to desist from promulgating
the new heresy. Against this, Sophronius,
having become patriarch of Jerusalem, published his
synodical letter quoted above. Maximus went on to
the west, visiting Rome and Carthage, and rousing the
African bishops against the heresy. He showed his
great dialectical skill in a contest with Pyrrhus, then
the deposed successor of the patriarch Sergius. Pyrrhus
even accompanied him to Rome, and renounced the
heresy before Pope Theodorus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Maximus continued at Rome to use all his efforts
against the heresy, and counselled Pope Martin to call
the Lateran Synod, and formally condemn it. As the
Ecthesis of Sergius had been composed against Sophronius,
and then the Typus—drawn up by the patriarch
Paul, and imposed by the will of the emperor Constans
II.—had been substituted for it at Constantinople,
the Council of the Lateran which in 649 condemned
both, excited the bitterest wrath of the emperor. Three
men had especially in his mind counter-worked all his
endeavours to impose his will as the standard of
faith upon the Romans and the bishops. These three
men were Sophronius, patriarch of Jerusalem, who had
died shortly after the surrender of his city to Omar,
Pope Martin, and the Abbot Maximus. How he
avenged himself on the Pope St. Martin has been already
described.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
About the same time at which the Pope was carried
off to Byzantium, in 653, Maximus also was seized, with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his two disciples, both named Anastasius, one a monk,
the other a Roman priest, who had been a nuncio.
They were carried also to Byzantium, and thrown into
prison. After the Pope had been judged by the senate,
and condemned to death for high treason, Maximus and
his disciples were also brought to trial.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Maximus had distinguished himself by a great number
of writings. He is considered the greatest theologian of
the seventh century. He has kept a very high rank
through all the centuries which have followed him.
After the death of Sophronius, the intellectual combat
against the Monothelite heresy rested mainly upon him.
The very high rank which he had held as a minister of
Heraclius, conjoined with his scientific defence of the
truth, made him the most conspicuous person in the
Church after the martyrdom of Pope Martin, whose
friend, counsellor, and supporter he had been, and his
unbending constancy under the severest tortures has
given him among the Greeks the name of <span class="tei tei-q">“the Confessor.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Part of a letter<a id="noteref_77" name="noteref_77" href="#note_77"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a> is extant from him to a certain Peter,
a man of high rank, who had entreated him to meet and
resist the patriarch Pyrrhus in the African conference.
With regard to him Maximus says: <span class="tei tei-q">“if Pyrrhus will
neither be heretical, nor be so-called, let him not satisfy
this or that individual. That is superfluous and unreasonable;
for just as when one is scandalised in him
all are scandalised, so when one is satisfied all surely
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
will be satisfied. Let him then hasten to satisfy before
all the Roman See. When this is satisfied all men
everywhere will accept his religion and orthodoxy. In
vain he speaks who would gain me and suchlike as me:
and does not satisfy and implore the most blessed Pope
of the holy Roman Church, that is, the Apostolic See,
which has received and holds the government, the
authority, and the power of binding and loosing over all
the holy Churches of God in the whole earth in all
persons and matters from the Incarnate Word of God
Himself, and likewise from all holy Councils according
to the sacred canons. For with him the Word who
rules the celestial virtues, binds and looses in heaven.
For if he thinks that others must be satisfied, and does
not implore the most Blessed Pope of Rome, he is like
the man who is accused of homicide, or any other crime,
and maintains his innocence not to him who by law is
appointed to judge him, but without any use or gain
strives to clear himself to other private men who have
no power to absolve him.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet more remarkable, if possible, is another testimony
which this great martyr, born and bred at
Constantinople, and up to the age of fifty a
minister of the eastern emperor, who bears the
greatest name among the theologians of the seventh
century, has left behind him. It was apparently
written at Rome after the completion of the Lateran
Council in 649, which he mentions in it, and numbers
with the five preceding ecumenical Councils. It
runs thus:—

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pope Martin, who held this great Council, at which
Maximus was present, supporting the Pope with all his
learning, had been seized, as we have seen, in his own
city and church, in the year 653, four years after it.
At the same time, Maximus, being about 73 years old,
was seized at the same place, and deported to Constantinople,
and upon his arrival was taken straight from the
ship, naked and without sandals, together with his two
disciples and companions, and they were put into
different prisons by five officers and their attendants.
Later, when the proceeding against the Pope had been;
closed, Maximus was brought into the palace before the
whole senate and a great crowd.<a id="noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href="#note_80"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a> He was placed in the
middle of the hall, and the fiscal angrily addressed him
with the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“Art thou a Christian?”</span> Maximus replied,
<span class="tei tei-q">“By the grace of God I am”</span>. <span class="tei tei-q">“That is not true.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Thou mayest say so, but God knows that I am a Christian.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“And if thou art a Christian, how canst thou
hate the emperor?”</span> asked the judge. <span class="tei tei-q">“But,”</span> replied
Maximus, <span class="tei tei-q">“how is this known to thee? Hatred, like
love, is a secret affection of the spirit.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“It is become
plain by thy deeds that thou hatest the emperor and his
realm, for it is only thou who hast delivered Egypt and
Alexandria and the Pentapolis, Tripolis and Africa into
the hands of the Saracens.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These accusations fell to the ground, as the false
witnesses brought could not maintain them. But the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
end of this trial was to condemn Maximus and his two
companions to a separate and severe exile.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Pyrrhus whom Maximus had so far prevailed
over in the famous conference held in Africa in 645,
that he had renounced his heresy to Pope Theodorus,
and been received by him in St. Peter's, who had then
fallen back through the influence of the exarch, and
been excommunicated, had succeeded in regaining the
see of Constantinople, upon the death of Paulus, the
author of Typus. After a few months, he had died
in the summer of 655. He was followed by Peter,
whose synodal letter, sent to Rome to Pope Eugenius,
is said to have been so dark on the subject of heresy
that the clergy and people would not suffer the Pope to
celebrate Mass in the Church of St. Mary until he had
promised not to accept this letter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Later in the summer, Maximus was again brought
into the judgement hall of the palace, where the two
Monothelite patriarchs—Peter of Constantinople and
Macedonius of Antioch, then living in the capital—were
present. <span class="tei tei-q">“Speak the truth,”</span> said Troilus to
him, <span class="tei tei-q">“and the emperor will have mercy on thee, for if
one of the accusations be proved juridically against
thee, thou wilt be guilty of death.”</span> Maximus declared
they were all false; that he had submitted the Typus
to anathema, not the emperor. The Lateran Council
was asserted to have no force for he who held it has
been deposed, <span class="tei tei-q">“Deposed he was not,”</span> said Maximus,
<span class="tei tei-q">“but expelled.”</span> Maximus and his companion, Anastasius,
were sent to different banishments.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A year later, a fresh attempt was made to break
down his resolution. Paul and Theodosius, two men of
consular rank, and Theodosius, Bishop of Cæsarea, the
latter as commissary of the patriarch, Peter, the former
two of the emperor, reached the imprisoned confessor
on the 24th August, 656. Every effort was made to
induce Maximus to accept the Typus, and enter into
communion with the see of Constantinople.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The terms which Maximus required were reported to
the emperor, and fresh commissaries, the patricians,
Troilus and Epiphanius, and the same bishop, Theodosius,
sent again to Maximus.<a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href="#note_81"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord of the
world sends us to thee,”</span> said Troilus, <span class="tei tei-q">“to inform thee
what it pleases him to require. Wilt thou obey his
command or not?”</span> Maximus requested that he might
hear the command. They required that he should first
answer the question. Maximus said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Before God and
Angels, and you all, I promise, what the emperor commands
me, in respect of earthly things, I will do”</span>. At
length Epiphanius said, <span class="tei tei-q">“The emperor by us informs
thee: since all the West and all the perverse-minded in
the East look to thee and make contention because of
thee, since they will not submit to us in faith, the emperor
wills to move thee that thou enter into communion
with us on the basis of the Typus issued by us. We
will then personally go out to Chalce, and embrace thee,
and offer thee our hand and, lead thee to the cathedral
with all honour and pomp, and place thee by our side
where the emperors are wont to sit, and we will then
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
partake of the life-giving Body and Blood of Christ,
and declare thee again for our father: and there will
be great joy not only in our own residence, but in all
the world. For we are well assured that if thou enterest
into communion with this holy see, all who have divided
themselves from our communion on thy account will
unite themselves to us again.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then Maximus turned to the bishop and said to him
with tears:—<span class="tei tei-q">“My good lord, we are all awaiting the
Day of Judgment. You know what we drew out, and
agreed upon respecting the holy Gospels, the life-giving
Cross, the image of our God and Saviour, and the all-holy
ever-virgin Mother who bore Him.”</span> The bishop cast
down his eyes, and said to him, in a lower voice:—<span class="tei tei-q">“What
can I do, since the emperor has chosen something
else?”</span> Maximus said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Why did you and those
with you touch the holy gospels, when you could not
bring about the promised issue? Indeed, the whole
power of heaven would not persuade me to do this.
For what answer shall I give, I say not to God, but to
my own conscience, that for the glory of men, which
has in it no substance, I have forsworn the faith which
saves those who cling to it.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At this word they all arose, their fury overmastering
them: they pushed and scratched and tore him; they
covered him with spittle from his head downwards, so
that his clothes reeked, until they were washed. And
the bishop, rising, said, this ought not to be done,
but his answer only should be heard, and then be reported
to our lord. For religious matters are done in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
different fashion from this. The bishop could scarcely
induce them to desist. They took their seats again,
and reviled him with indescribable insults, and imprecations.
Epiphanius said furiously, <span class="tei tei-q">“Malefactor and
cannibal, speakest thou thus, treating us and our city
and our emperor as heretics? We are more Christian
and orthodox than thou art. We confess that our Lord
and God has both a divine will and a human will,
and an intellectual soul, and that every intellectual
nature has by nature, Will, and Operation, since motion
belongs to life, and will to mind: and we know Him to
have the capacity of Will not only in the Godhead,
but also in the Manhood. Nor do we deny His Two
Wills and Two Operations.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The abbot, Maximus, answered:—<span class="tei tei-q">“If you so believe,
as the intellectual Natures and the Church of God,
why are you compelling me to communicate on the
terms of the Typus, which merely destroys those
things?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“That,”</span> said Epiphanius, <span class="tei tei-q">“has been done
for accommodation, that the people may not be injured
by these subtleties.”</span> Maximus said:—<span class="tei tei-q">“On the contrary,
every man is sanctified by accurate confession of
the faith, not by its destruction, as put in the Typus”</span>.
<span class="tei tei-q">“I told thee in the palace,”</span> said Troilus, <span class="tei tei-q">“that it did
not destroy, but bade silence be kept that we may all
live in peace.”</span> Maximus answered:—<span class="tei tei-q">“What is
covered in silence is destroyed. The Holy Spirit says
by the prophet:—<span class="tei tei-q">‘There are no speeches nor languages,
where their voices are not heard’</span>: a word not spoken
is no word at all.”</span> Troilus said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Keep in thy heart
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
what thou wilt; no one prevents thee”</span>. Maximus
answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“But God did not limit salvation to the heart
when he said:—<span class="tei tei-q">‘He that confesseth Me before men, I
will confess him before My Father in heaven,’</span> and the
Apostle, <span class="tei tei-q">‘With the heart we believe unto justice, but with
the mouth confession is made to salvation’</span>. If then God,
and God's prophets and apostles bid the great and terrible
mystery which saves all the world to be confessed by
holy voices, there is no need that the voice which proclaims
it be in any way silenced, in order that the salvation
of those who are silent be not impaired.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then Epiphanius, speaking most harshly, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Didst
thou sign the writing?”</span> he meant the Lateran Council.
Abbot Maximus said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, I signed”</span>. <span class="tei tei-q">“And how
didst thou dare to sign, and anathematise those who
confess and believe as the intellectual Natures and
the Catholic Church? In my judgment thou shalt
be taken into the city, and be put in chains in the
forum, and the actors and actresses, and the women
that stand for hire, and all the people shall be brought,
that every man and woman may slap thee, and spit
in thy face.”</span> Abbot Maximus replied:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Be it as
thou hast said, if we have anathematised those who
confess Two Natures of which the Lord is, and the two
natural Wills and Operations corresponding to Him who
is both God and Man. Read, my Lord, the acts and
decree, and if what you have said is found, do all your
will. For I, and my fellow-servants, who have subscribed,
have anathematised those who, according to
Arius and Apollinarius, maintain one Will and Operation,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and who do not confess our Lord and God to be intellectual
in each of those Natures of which, in which, and
which He is: and, therefore, in both of them having
Will and Operation of our salvation.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They said, <span class="tei tei-q">“If we go on treating with this man, we
shall neither eat nor drink. Let us go, and take food,
and report what we have heard. For this man has sold
himself to the devil. They went in and dined, and
made their report, it being the eve of the Exaltation of
the life-giving Cross in the year 656.”</span><a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href="#note_82"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The next day, Theodosius, the Consul, came out
early to the aforesaid Abbot Maximus, and took away
all that he had, and said, in the emperor's name:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Since
thou wilt not have honour, it shall be far from
thee. Go to the place thou hast thought thyself
worthy of, suffering the judgment of thy disciples, him
at Mesembria, and him at Perberi.”</span> The patricians
Troilus and Epiphanius had said:—<span class="tei tei-q">“We will bring
the two disciples, him at Mesembria, and him at Perberi,
and put them, too, to the proof, and see the result.
But learn, Sir Abbot, that, when we get a little relief
from this rout of heathens (that is, the Saracens), by
the Holy Trinity, we will bring you to terms, and your
Pope, who is now lifted up, and all the talkers there,
and the rest of your disciples: and we will <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cook</span></em> you
all, each in his own place, as Martin has been cooked”</span>.
And the Consul Theodosius took him and committed
him to soldiers, and they took him to Perberis. It is
not known how long what is called the second exile of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
St. Maximus lasted, which ensued after he had thus
resisted the offers of the emperor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At a later time, he was brought from Perberis, with
his disciple, Anastasius, back to Constantinople.<a id="noteref_83" name="noteref_83" href="#note_83"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a> A
Synod, there held, excommunicated them both, as well
as Pope St. Martin, St. Sophronius, and all the orthodox.<a id="noteref_84" name="noteref_84" href="#note_84"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">84</span></span></a>
The second Anastasius, who had been a Nuncio,
was also brought, and the Synod passed on all three
the sentence:—<span class="tei tei-q">“As the Synod has passed against you
its canonical sentence, it only remains that you be subject
to the severity of the civil laws for your impiety.
And though no punishment could be proportionate to
your crimes, we, leaving you to the just Judge in respect
of the greater punishment, grant you the indulgence of
the present life, modifying the strict severity of the
laws. We order that you be delivered to the prefect,
and by him taken to the guard: that you be then
scourged; that in you, Maximus and Anastasius, and
Anastasius, the instrument of your iniquity, the blaspheming
tongue be cut out to the roots, and then your
right hand, which has served your blaspheming mind,
be cut off: that thus deprived of these execrable members,
you be carried through the twelve quarters of this
imperial city, and then be delivered to perpetual banishment
and prison, to lament for the remainder of your
errors.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This sentence was carried out by the prefect. St.

Maximus was then transported to Lazika, in Colchis:
the other two to different castles. As Maximus, from
weakness, could neither ride nor bear a carriage, he was
borne on a sort of bed made of branches to the Castle
of Schemarum. St. Maximus foretold the day of his
death, which took place on the 13th August, 662,
when he was eighty-two years old. At that moment
the chalif Muawiah had about completed the first year
in which he had fixed the seat of the Saracenic empire
at Damascus: and the <span class="tei tei-q">“rout of heathen”</span> from which
the Byzantine Consul had anticipated deliverance, held
in peril during the whole of Muawiah's reign to 680
the imperial city on the Bosphorous, where <span class="tei tei-q">“the lord
of the world”</span> usually resided.

Ali, the sword has severed from the throne of Constantine
its fairest provinces, and conquered besides a
territory, the whole mass of which exceeded the Roman
empire at its greatest extension. The sword of Mohammed's
successors in doing this has inflicted deadly
wounds on the Christian patriarchates and dioceses
subjected to the new dominion. It has also reduced
the unsubdued portion of the eastern empire to tremble

It is necessary to consider in his personal life the man
who gives name to this immense movement, who raised
the banner which flouted the Cross and wrote upon that
banner the symbol of human enjoyment against that of
divine abasement. The facts of his life which I wish to
note are especially those which are reproduced in his
religion. They pass beyond the sphere of the individual
because they reappear incessantly in the history of twelve
hundred and fifty years, and affect nations of the south

Mohammed<a id="noteref_85" name="noteref_85" href="#note_85"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">85</span></span></a> was born in April, 571, in the city of
Mecca, of a family possessing spiritual rank in that home
of ancient pilgrimages for the Arabian tribes. But the
branch to which he belonged was poor. His father,
Abdallah, died about the time of his birth. His mother,
Aminah, born in Medina, was so poor that she could
scarcely support a nurse for him. His mother died when
he was six years old. His grandfather then took care of
him, but died also after two years. From that time his
uncle, Abu Talib, provided for him, but was so poor likewise
that the orphan child was presently reduced to tend
sheep, whereas the rich class at Mecca was largely
engaged in traffic with their caravans, which visited
Abyssinia, Southern Arabia, Syria, Egypt, and Persia.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Mohammed is said in his youth to have twice visited
Syria, probably as a camel driver. But it is said with
greater certainty that at twenty-five he entered the
service of a rich widow, Chadidja, and journeyed for her in
South Arabia. He afterwards married her, and then for
the first time became sufficiently rich to turn the
thoughts which slumbered within him to higher subjects
than procuring his daily bread.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His marriage with Chadidja lasted till he was fifty
years of age, when he lost her and at the same time his
uncle Abu Talib. During the whole period of his
marriage with Chadidja, who was much older than himself,
he lived in close union with her—what seems to have
been, at least in regard to this relationship—a virtuous
and religious life. Mohammed's education had been
much neglected. His country at the time was in a most
uncivilised condition, destitute of science, arts, and
letters. Bardship alone was in repute, and for this
Mohammed had no gift, though he had a great gift of
oratory. The art of writing was little diffused; it is
doubtful whether Mohammed even in his later years
possessed it. He was acquainted with Jewish and
Christian doctrines only by oral information. The great
authority of St. John of Damascus says that he lighted
upon the Old and New Testaments by conferences with
an Arian monk, and thus drew up his own religion. He
was about forty years of age when he began to carry out
a design to restore what he thought the religion of
Abraham, and to destroy the idolatry into which his
countrymen had fallen. He met with small success and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
much opposition in this attempt until in the eleventh
year of the mission which he claimed as prophet, and
the fifty-first of his life, a most marked change in his
personal conduct and in the conditions of his life took
place.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The chief men at Mecca had generally refused to receive
him as a prophet and to accept the reformation of
religion which he proposed to them. In his first years
he had confined his revelations to his nearest relations
and friends. He had gained Abu Bekr and his young
cousin Ali, an uncle Hamza, named for his valour <span class="tei tei-q">“the
Lion of God,”</span> and above all, Omar, at first his opponent,
but when converted the most energetic character among
all the companions of the prophet, and the strongest
support of Islam. On the whole, however, things had
gone so far against him that he retired secretly, together
with Abu Bekr, from Mecca to Medina. This event,
termed The Flight, took place in September, 622, from
which year his followers count their time. It may be
taken as indeed the time in which his full character as
prophet came forth to light. Henceforth he appeared
rather as the preacher of a new religion than as the
restorer of what he called the religion of Abraham.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The most important principle laid down by him from
the time of his migration from Mecca to Medina was
that he then first permitted in the name of God war
against unbelievers. He afterwards made this a holy
duty. It was considered the first of virtues to fight the
enemies of Islam. To those who fell in such a battle he
promised the highest joys of paradise; to those who
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rejected him he threatened a shameful death by the
disposition of God.<a id="noteref_86" name="noteref_86" href="#note_86"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">86</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Upon his first settlement in Medina, which afterwards
changed its original name of Jathripp into this new name,
signifying the city, he built a mosque and arranged
worship, in which a short prayer was offered five times
a day. He sought at first to gain over the Jews residing
there, and marked Jerusalem as the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Kiblah</span></span>, that is,
the point to which the face should be turned in prayer,
and the tenth day of the first month as a fast day, and
allowed Jewish converts to keep the Sabbath.<a id="noteref_87" name="noteref_87" href="#note_87"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">87</span></span></a> But
when he found that the Jews would receive a Messias
only of the race of David he became their bitterest
enemy. Later he appointed Mecca instead of Jerusalem
as the Kiblah, the month Ramadhan as fasting time,
and Friday as the day of rest.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His first campaigns, when he could scarcely bring a
few hundred men into the field, for the inhabitants of
Medina had not yet joined him, but had only granted
him protection, were but predatory attacks on the
caravans of Mecca, which came near Medina. But when
the Meccans grew prudent, and either defended their
caravans with a strong escort, or sent them round by
bye-paths to Syria, Mohammed planned a plundering
attack in one of the holy months, when every Arab
deemed himself secure. This is the beginning of a
number of actions which, though he was not endued
with a delicate moral sense, he must have known to be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
bad, and only ordered, or at least approved, for the sake
of the end aimed at, chastisement of the heathen, and
breaking in upon their commerce. What Mohammed
did was to call his follower Abdallah, to give him a
sealed packet, and instruct him to go to South Arabia
with twelve companions. He was not to open the
packet before the third day, and then fulfil the order it
contained. Abdallah obeyed, broke the seal on the
third day, and found only the words: Go with thy
companions to the valley of Nachlah (south-east of
Mecca), and there wait for the caravans of Mecca.
Words which Abdallah interpreted to mean that he
should fall upon these caravans. This he accomplished
without difficulty. Two men were taken prisoners, one
killed, and the whole lading carried as plunder to
Medina. Mohammed had plainly used this short and
sealed packet to cut off all explanation with Abdallah
respecting an act of rapine in the sacred months, so as
to be able to put away the responsibility from himself,
as might be needed. Even the Moslim at Medina had
but one cry of reprobation over this desecration of the
sacred months. Mohammed at first disavowed Abdallah
as having gone beyond his command, for he had not
told him to attack the caravans in the sacred months.
But when he found himself considered no less the author
of this deed, and as he did not mean for the future to
secure to Mecca four tranquil mouths for its commerce,
Koran verses were published in which war against unbelievers
was excused at every time, because they committed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the much greater sin of driving the prophet out
of his country.<a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href="#note_88"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The attempt to exculpate Mohammed from the guilt
of the blood murderously shed in falling upon this
caravan is made the more difficult because his
biographers speak of many other murders ordered by
him even in the case of women, and extol him for such
things. It may be noted that in the last time before
his flight he was no longer true and sincere. Thus he
recorded the whole history of the Old and New Testament
prophets, adorned with many Jewish and Christian
legends, which he maintained, as was his wont, to have
been revealed to him by the angel Gabriel. This did
not impose upon the inhabitants of Mecca, who were
right in ascribing his knowledge of these things to
intercourse with foreign informants less illiterate than
himself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first proper fight between Mohammed and the
Meccans took place in the second year of the Hegira at
Bedr, a station between Medina and Mecca. Mohammed
had gone out with somewhat more than 300 men
to surprise and plunder certain rich caravans on their
return from Syria. Abu Sofian, the head of the Omeiad
line, led these caravans, and had notice of Mohammed's
purpose. He sent an express to Mecca inviting his
townsmen to despatch an armed escort to defend their
property. Before these, 900 strong, arrived, Abu
Sofian, knowing that Mohammed lay in wait for him at
Bedr, succeeded in passing round this place by directing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his caravans in security along the coast road. When
news that their goods were safe reached the Meccan
camp, a portion of the escort, which had taken arms
only through fear of losing their property, wished to
return. The rest, bitter enemies of Mohammed, and
also fighting men, preferred to advance upon Bedr.
This was resolved upon, but many in the force persisted
in returning to Mecca. The same hesitation
prevailed in the prophet's camp: which had come out
intending to plunder, not for a fight with an enemy still
continuing to be in number. But yet greater was the
fear of showing cowardice, and so striking the new faith
with the hardest blow. So they came to a bloody
conflict, in which the disciplined Medinese prevailed
over the Meccans whom their commercial habits had
partly enfeebled. They carried off rich plunder.
Mohammed did not himself fight: he was praying in a
hut until he sank exhausted, and when he recovered
consciousness, announced a victory to his friends obtained
by the aid of celestial warriors. This first deed
of arms laid the basis for a rapid increase of Mohammedanism.
It gave the poor community spoil in arms, in
horses, and in camels, and in no little ransom for the
prisoners taken. It strengthened their confidence, increased
their following, and encouraged them to further
enterprise. The Jewish tribe Keinuka was their first
prey. It was compelled to unconditional surrender,
and would probably have been entirely massacred if a
free retreat had not been obtained for it by Abd Allah,
the head of an Arabian clan dwelling in Medina, with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whom these Jews had been in former alliance. But all
their goods went to the Moslem. At this time occur
many slayings of particularly hated or dangerous enemies
of Islam. So Mohammed inflicted a great terror which
reduced to silence individual opponents, and carried
waverers into the bosom of Islam, which promised them
security.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, in the meantime, the Meccans were not idle.
Both interest and honour required them to avenge the defeat
at Bedr. Abu Sofian, in the year 625, the third of
the Hegira, appeared at the head of 3000 men, and occupied
a camp to the east of Medina. Mohammed wished
to confine himself to the defence of the city, but his
more fanatic followers denounced this conduct as
cowardice, and he was compelled to march out with
about a thousand men, of whom nearly a third were
commanded by Abd Allah: This man, a secret enemy
of Mohammed, returned back into the city. The
Moslim, however, in spite of their small number, fought
with effect at Mount Ohod, north of Medina, until
the bowmen, who were ranged against the enemy's
horsemen, deserted their post, and the impetuous
Chalid fell upon their retreat. A panic seized the
believers, so that they sought safety in flight. Mohammed
himself was wounded, and sank to the ground,
so that a report of his death was spread, which added
to the discomfiture of his host. But a faithful henchman
recognised him by the eyes alone, in spite of mail-coat,
helmet, and visor, and brought him to safety,
while the Meccans, believing his death, cared not to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
pursue the other fugitives, and were retiring. Only
after the battle was ended, Abu Sofian learnt that he
was still alive. Mohammed, the day after the battle,
in which he lost 70 men, pursued the enemy for some
distance, only to show that he was not discouraged.
The defeat at Ohod lessened Mohammed's reputation as
much as the victory at Bedr had raised it. The only considerable
gain which Mohammed, in the fourth year of the
Hegira, could offer to his believers to make up for the
losses suffered, was the expulsion of the Jews of the
clan Nadir, who had lands and many strong castles near
Medina. They surrendered these, and as there had
been no battle, Mohammed confiscated their property,
and bestowed it on his party of fugitives from Mecca.
At the end of this year he appeared near Bedr with a
larger force, to show that he was not afraid to defy Abu
Sofian, who had threatened a fresh attack after the
battle at Ohod. But the Meccans were not ready, and,
moreover, would not fight on a bad year. Towards
the end of the fifth year, in 627, they appeared again
under Abu Sofian, about ten thousand strong, with
their allies, out of various Bedouin clans before Medina.
The Medinese could hardly set 3000 men against them,
and were, in general, down-hearted, fearing an attack
besides from the Jewish clan, Kureiza. This time Mohammed
maintained his plan not to meet the enemy in
the open field, but only to defend the town. By the
advice of a Persian he drew a broad trench about it.
Slight as this defence was, it sufficed, in the Arab
ignorance of the art of siege, to keep the enemy from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
an attack in force. Bad weather ensued, and Mohammed
succeeded in sowing distrust of each other among
the confederates, so that they retired after doing
nothing. But, though the siege of Medina had cost
Mohammed little material loss, his reputation as
warrior and as prophet had suffered greatly, as at
Ohod. Instead of following the Arabian custom, to
offer battle, he had cowered behind walls and trenches.
Again he turned first against the Jews, who had
entered into negotiations with the Meccans. After a
few weeks, he compelled them to surrender. These
were of the clan Kureiza, formerly confederates with
the second large Arabian clan domiciled in Medina.
They hoped, through the mediation of this clan, to get
as good conditions as the clan Keinuka had obtained
through Abd Allah. But the head of this clan had
been wounded during the siege of the city, and when
Mohammed appealed to his judgment, he condemned to
death the men whose number ran from 600 to 900, and
their wives and children to slavery. Mohammed had
this hard sentence executed immediately in the marketplace
of Medina. This expedition was followed by
others against hostile Bedouin clans. Thus the bad
impression left by the siege was gradually effaced. So
at the end of the sixth year of the Hegira, 628, Mohammed
was able to resolve, at the head of his friends,
as well believers as heathen Arabs in alliance with him,
on a pilgrimage to Mecca. He issued a solemn invitation
to join this pilgrimage. It met with small acceptance.
He had issued it in the name of God, and so
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was obliged to carry it out, though it was attended by
an inconsiderable number, as to which the accounts
vary between 700 and 1400 men. He had to trust to
the Arab reluctance to shed blood in the sacred months,
though he had himself violated one sacred month by
murder and robbery. Finding the Meccans resolute to
forbid him entrance into their city, he had to halt on
the border of the holy territory. After long treating,
agreement was made that he should retire for that year,
but should be allowed in the following year to pass
three days in Mecca on pilgrimage. The Meccans, for
the sake of their commerce, were as anxious for peace
as Mohammed, and so a truce for ten years was struck,
which yet had this favourable condition for them, that,
while their fugitives were to be given up, those of
Mohammed might be secure in Mecca.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This repulse of the prophet and his companions from
the holy city and its temple was deeply felt, yet there
were advantages obtained by this seemingly dishonouring
truce. Mohammed appeared at least to be recognised
by the proud city as an equal power. Now he might
send out his missionaries into every part of Arabia,
make proselytes and conclude alliances, and the right to
enter Mecca the next year with those who believed in
him was something gained which perceptibly advanced
his claim among the Arabians. To increase his strength,
enrich his followers, and so enlarge their numbers and
efface by a new victory the bad impression which the
failure of the pilgrimage had caused, he attacked the
Jews of Cheiber, who had lands and several castles four
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or five days' journey north-east of Medina. These were
successively stormed and sacked, and all that the rest
could do was to surrender to the conqueror on condition
that they should serve him for the future as tenants who
should give him half the produce of the land. So by
the conquest of other Jews he was able to increase the
number of his troops.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the year 628-629 which passed between the failure
of the pilgrimage to Mecca, and the subsequent pilgrimage
carried out according to the treaty, several attacks
on the Bedouins took place. The number of his believers
and allies increased, and the thought was more
and more developed in Mohammed that Islam must by
degrees be accepted as the only true religion not only by
all Arabians but by all the nations of the earth. Even
before he had obtained possession of Mecca he sent
messengers to the neighbouring princes of Persia,
Byzantium, and Abyssinia, as well as to the Christian
governor of Egypt, and to several Arabian chiefs subject
to Byzantine or Persian sovereignty, inviting them
to be converted to his faith. These embassies had no
result, and were rejected with more or less harshness.
Only the Greek governor of Egypt gave them a friendly
reception, and without being converted to Islam sent
the prophet costly presents, among them two slave
women, of whom one, Mariam, so greatly charmed
Mohammed that for her company he neglected his
wives.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For the man who had been faithful to his old wife
Chadidja until her death, when he was past fifty years
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of age, had from the time that he came forward, not
merely as the restorer of a primitive religion which had
suffered corruptions, but as the herald of a new religion,
say from the date of the Hegira itself, espoused about a
dozen wives,<a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89" href="#note_89"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a>
some for love and some for policy, to make
alliance with families of repute. Among these was
Aischa, daughter of Abu Bekr, whom he took when
scarcely out of her childhood, a daughter of Omar, and
a sister of Abd Allah, who had been disgraced by the
violation of a sacred month. The Koran limits the
number of lawful wives to four, but Mohammed himself
was to be an exception. At the time polygamy in
Arabia had no restriction, and as public opinion was not
shocked, his wives had to submit. But when Mariam,
the Abyssinian slave, assumed the position of a dangerous
rival, they complained to their families, and
showed their contempt to the faithless husband. He
promised to quit the favoured slave, but he dwelt with
her for a month apart from his wives and then produced
verses of the Koran, dispensing him from his
promise respecting Mariam, and threatening his wives
that if they continued in their disobedience he would
take instead of them more submissive wives and virgins.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But a more important incident in the domestic life of
Mohammed was to occur, which showed how entirely he
was led away by sensual passion.<a id="noteref_90" name="noteref_90" href="#note_90"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">90</span></span></a> He had fallen in love
with Zeineb, the wife of Zeid, formerly his slave, then
his adopted son, and one of the most attached among
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his followers. Zeid perceived this and was willing to
cede her to the man who was not only his prophet but
his benefactor. The prophet took her, and added her to
the number of his wives. But the Arabians, though
they practised unlimited polygamy, did not allow to
marry the wife of an adopted son, whom they considered
in the light of a real son. Mohammed felt the scandal,
and produced a passage from the Koran. In it he declared
in the name of God the custom hitherto entertained
of treating adopted children as really children to
be foolish, and for the future even sinful. Then he
spread the belief that Zeid's divorce from his wife had
taken place against his own advice; he makes God
remind him in a following verse how notwithstanding
his own love for her he had counselled Zeid to keep
her; and how even after the divorce, he had shrunk,
through fear of men, from espousing her until God had
expressly commanded it,<a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href="#note_91"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a> and this for two reasons, first,
to shew that he who acts after the will of God should
not heed the tattle of men; and secondly to give by his
own example the more force to the newly-enacted law
in regard of adopted sons; a law, he added, which
earlier prophets, whom he takes care not to name, had
promulgated.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But this marriage<a id="noteref_92" name="noteref_92" href="#note_92"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">92</span></span></a> also led to further revelations in the
Koran, which entirely severed the wives of Mohammed
from the male world: and also separated the other
believing women by a thick veil from the eyes of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
strangers. Mohammed's jealousy stretched even beyond
the grave, and he forbade second marriage to his
wives even after his death. The object was to restrict
them from all life in public to their own homes, and
even there, to intercourse with their own sex, or only
their nearest male relations. In spite of their polygamy,
the wife had hitherto among the Arabians been the companion
of their life: Mohammed reduced her to be a
house-slave. She became in Islam a holy thing, indeed:
but a holy thing kept under veil and bolt, and
guarded not by her own virtue, but by eunuchs, from
desecration.<a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href="#note_93"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mohammed's invitation to the governor of Egypt,
followed by the gift of the slave woman to Mohammed,
led to disastrous consequences in Islam to woman's
position. The prophet called in God to sanction man's
lordship over woman: the first time in history that
such a corruption claimed a divine sanction.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the eighth year of the Hegira, January, 630,
Mohammed obtained possession of Mecca. To avenge
a rupture of the existing truce, he broke with 10,000
men into the neighbourhood of the city, which admitted
him both as its temporal lord and as the
prophet of God, without a fight. He received the
homage of its inhabitants on one of the city's hills,
and their oath to follow him in all wars against
unbelievers. At the same time, he declared Mecca
to be again a holy city, in which God had allowed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
him alone to shed blood, which, for the future, was
never to be.<a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href="#note_94"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After gaining this possession of Mecca, Mohammed
issued in the ninth Sura of the Koran what amounted
to a new law of nations, and a new practice of war.
From that time forward none but Mohammedans were
to enter the holy city of Mecca and its circle: but likewise,
outside of this, idolaters were to be exterminated,
Jews and Christians were only to be suffered, when they
paid tribute, and humbled themselves.<a id="noteref_95" name="noteref_95" href="#note_95"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">95</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“O true believers,
verily the idolaters are unclean: let them not
therefore, come near unto the holy temple after this
year. And if ye fear want by the cutting off trade and
communication with them, God will enrich you with
His abundance, if He pleaseth, for God is knowing and
wise. Fight against them who believe not in God, nor
in the Last Day, and who forbid not that which God
and His Apostle have forbidden, and profess not the
true religion of those to whom the Scriptures have
been delivered, until they pay tribute by right of subjection,
and they be reduced low. The Jews say Ezra
is the son of God, and the Christians say Christ is the
Son of God. This is their saying in their mouths: they
imitate the saying of those who were unbelievers in
former times. May God resist them. How are they
infatuated! Besides God, they take their priests and
their monks for their lords, and Christ, the Son of
Mary; only they are commanded to worship one God
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
only. There is no God but He. Far be that from Him
which they associate with Him. They seek to extinguish
the light of God with their mouths: but God
willeth no other than to perfect His light, although the
infidels be averse thereto. It is He who hath sent His
Apostle with the direction and true religion, that He
may cause it to appear superior to every other religion,
although the idolaters be averse thereto.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This Sura was the last in time of those issued. <span class="tei tei-q">“It<a id="noteref_96" name="noteref_96" href="#note_96"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">96</span></span></a> bears the stamp of much reflection and careful execution.”</span>
In March, 631, Mohammed had sent the greater
pilgrimage to Mecca, under guidance of Abu Bekr.
This Sura was published on the chief day of the pilgrimage,
and <span class="tei tei-q">“its promulgation committed to Ali,<a id="noteref_97" name="noteref_97" href="#note_97"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">97</span></span></a>
who rode for that purpose on the prophet's slit-eared
camel from Medina to Mecca, and, standing up before
the whole assembly at Al Akaba, told them that he
was the messenger of the Apostle of God unto them”</span>.
Thus it establishes the definitive position of Mohammed
in regard to all other religions, and the exclusiveness
of his own claim.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the last days of Mohammed, when the religious
capital of Arabia had been taken by him, and this new
law of war had been published, embassies from all parts
of Arabia streamed to him, for to the Arabians there
remained no choice between the Koran and the sword.
He may be considered as the lord by conquest of
Arabia, and moreover as one who pretended to issue in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the name of God and as His sole apostle a new world-religion.
Scarcely more than a year after this proclamation
of war against what he chose to consider idolatry
he died on the 8th June 632, at the age of 63 lunar or
61 solar years.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When we review the ten years which elapsed from the
Hegira to the death of Mohammed, the following points
are salient.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The imposition of religious belief by force becomes
more and more the main principle of Mohammed. As
he increases in power the principle is set forth with
greater distinctness. He began as a citizen of Mecca by
trying to persuade his relations and friends. With some
he succeeded. His kinsmen gave him a partial support
rather of clanship than of faith. But he found it expedient
to fly from his native city, and the flight marks
to all future time the beginning of his assumption not
only to be a prophet, but in that character to publish
a new religion. The Flight is the Mohammedan era as
the birth of Christ is the Christian. At the end of the
ninth year the proclamation against idolatry in the
ninth Sura, the last in time of the whole series, marks
the completion of the parent idea. Mohammed declares
himself the apostle of God, as such alone charged <span class="tei tei-q">“with
the direction and true religion,”</span> while Christians,
though they are commanded <span class="tei tei-q">“to worship one God only,
associate Christ the Son of Mary with Him”</span>. Whereas
Mohammed declares Christ to be indeed one in the series
of prophets, the last before himself; but himself to be
the prophet who completes the chain. Thus he enacts
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that Christians can be safe before his people only in one
of two ways, either by forming part of them, that is, by
taking Mohammed instead of Christ, or by submitting
to pay tribute, and to the humiliations which accompany
tribute. Thus the parent idea is the messiahship of force.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be noted that it comes out in a profession of
faith drawn especially to exclude the association of the
Son of Mary with God. Thus Mohammed crowns the
work which Arius attempted three hundred years
before. After the restless heresies in which the
Greek mind had fluctuated during these three centuries,
the greatest enemy to the Greek empire
and faith was set up on that very negation of the
godhead of Christ with which those heresies had
begun. Fifty years of Arian success, in which the
emperors, Constantius and Valens, take a large part,
inspired and supported by Eusebius, Macedonius,
Eudoxius, and Demophilus, four successive bishops of
Byzantium, cause that disorganisation of the eastern
Church which St. Basil described as its ruin. Fifty
years of patronising the Monothelite heresy, in which
the emperors Heraclius and Constans II. bear the largest
part, supported by four Byzantine patriarchs, Sergius,
Pyrrhus, Paulus, and Peter, beginning in 628, mark
the rise and accompany the establishment of the Mohammedan
empire and creed. Honorius dies before the
heresy is presented for acceptance in Rome in the
imperial Ecthesis. Ten Popes succeeding Honorius, in
spite of the temporal distress which surrounds them,
oppose to the utmost the Byzantine heresy and despotism
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the midst of whom one gloriously lays down his life
and is martyred by the eastern emperor as guilty of high
treason. This is the connection between Arius and
Mohammed, who appears as the divine punishment and
remedy for Byzantine successors of Constantine who
would confiscate the liberty of the church, and for state-made
patriarchs who foster and formulate heresy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, the revelations which Mohammed professes
to receive from God he professes also to be brought to
him by the Angel Gabriel. Nor is he ashamed to make
this angel serve him in actions of the utmost turpitude.
Thus when the governor of Egypt bestows on him the
slave-girl Mariam, he falls so desperately in love with
her that his proper wives, including his favourite, the
girl-wife Aischa, the daughter of his chief adherent,
Abu Bekr, revolt. The prophet is embarrassed and
summons the Angel Gabriel to his aid. Forthwith a
passage of the Koran preaches to the discontented wives
obedience in the name of God, and the prophet threatens
that if they continue to be insubordinate he will dismiss
them and find others more obedient and submissive.
Nor is even this the lowest depth of infamy. For when
he violates even the customs of the Arabs around him,
loose as they were, and favourable to the selfishness of
the stronger sex, and takes the wife of his most faithful
follower and adopted son, he calls in Gabriel to justify
the adultery in the name of God, and to enlarge to any
extent which the prophet may choose his exclusive
privilege of taking wives. It would be difficult to say
how the stamp of imposture could be fixed on the Koran
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with more convincing force than by this association of
an angel and of God himself with acts which are contrary
to the universal natural law.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thirdly, it may be remarked that as to polygamy,
since it was the custom of the Arabians in his time to
practise it without restraint, Mohammed might be considered
as neither better nor worse than his countrymen,
who had so corrupted the purity of the original law of
marriage. This might be allowed if we were considering
Mohammed simply as a Saracen of that time. But we are
considering him in the light in which he put himself
forward as the apostle of God, the one apostle who was
to set forth the one God: <span class="tei tei-q">“there is but one God and
Mohammed is his prophet”</span>. It is in this character that
he did what no one had ever done before. Polygamy
had crept in, <span class="tei tei-q">“through the hardness of men's hearts,”</span>
but Mohammed attempted to set by his appeal to God
and his use of the Angel Gabriel a divine sanction upon
this great corruption, and upon the unlimited concubinage
which he practised himself, and authorised in others.
Thus St. John Damascene a hundred years after his
time used of him these indignant words: <span class="tei tei-q">“This Mamed
put together many foolish things. Thus in the writing
entitled <span class="tei tei-q">‘Woman’</span> he lays down the law that a man may
openly take four wives, and a thousand concubines if he
can, as many as he can subject to himself<a id="noteref_98" name="noteref_98" href="#note_98"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">98</span></span></a> besides the
four; and he may divorce when he pleases and take
another. And he made this law for the following
reason.”</span> Then St. John narrates the case of Zeid and his

wife in these words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Zeid had a handsome wife;
Mamed fell in love with her. As they sat together
Mamed said, God has charged me to take thy wife.
Zeid answered: Thou art the apostle, do as God told
thee. Or to go further back, he said: God charged me
that thou divorce thy wife. Zeid divorced her. After
some days Mamed said: God also charged me to take
her. So he took her and made her an adulteress, and
then he enacted that every one who will may divorce
his wife, and after the divorce, if she return to him,
another must marry her first.”</span><a id="noteref_99" name="noteref_99" href="#note_99"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">99</span></span></a>

Patriarchs and prophets have sinned, as well as
common men; but Mohammed is the only legislator
who has called in God to sanction his sin, and propagate
it among others in the name of God: and he did
this under the title that he was the special apostle of
God, sent to propagate the only true religion. The
terrible sin of David stands out as contrary to all his
previous life. He sought pardon for it, and after it
became the great penitent, and humbly bowed his head
beneath chastisements as awful as his own sin.
Mohammed exulted in his sin, as deserving of praise
and exceptional privilege.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fourthly, throughout the ten years, from the Hegira
to his death, Mohammed carried out his own principle
of propagating religion by force in his utter disregard of
human life. As soon as he had left Mecca he practised
robbery upon its caravans and killed without scruple
those who resisted the robbery. He tried to make
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
friends with Jewish clans around him, and when they
rejected him for their Messias, slew them by hundreds.
He slew even for private revenge those who stood in
his way: and women as well as men.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These alleged revelations become in Mohammed's
hands the enactments of a sovereign legislator. He
claims them to be words of God delivered to him by
the angel Gabriel. The personal character of Mohammed
as developed in them is, therefore, of the greatest importance.
He speaks not only of his <span class="tei tei-q">“brother Moses”</span>
in the Jewish legislation which he closes, but of the
Son of Mary as the Word and Spirit of God, on whose
work he sets the superior seal of his own mission; and
as a matter of fact, those who took his name had his
personal character and actions before them for a standard,
as the Christians had the Son of God. From the
moment of his death this fact is brought out by the
conduct of his followers. His chief companions meet
and elect a head whom they call the chalif or successor
of the prophet. That title is the sole source of his
authority, which is both religious and civil, supreme
in each, but supreme because it is the transmitted
authority of the Prophet who is not a prophet only,
but the <span class="tei tei-q">“Apostle of God”</span>. The four points above noted,
the propagation of religion by force, the imposture in
the use of the name of Gabriel, the enacting of polygamy
with the superadded license of unbounded concubinage,
and the employment of murder as means
of success, mark the intense antagonism between the
character of Mohammed and the character of Him
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whom he charged the Christians with associating to God.
Instead of the Man, meek and humble of heart, who
said to His disciples that in following His meekness and
humility they should find rest for their souls, we have
the man who ordered the believers in him to beat down
all idolaters that did not profess, <span class="tei tei-q">“There is one God,
and Mohammed is His prophet,”</span> and made death in
battle against them to be the martyrdom which he chose
for his people. Instead of the Man who said, <span class="tei tei-q">“If I had
not done among them the works which no other man
hath done, they would not have sin,”</span> we have the man
who answered the appeal made to him for miraculous
works in testimony of his mission, by disclaiming the
power to do them. Instead of the Virgin's Son who
set up the virginal life, and propagated His faith by
the teaching and example of those who followed it, we
have the man who forged a divine permission for the
grossest polygamy and an unlimited concubinage obtained
by successful war. Instead of the Man who
reverenced above all men the sanctuary of human life,
we have the man who murdered without scruple those
who did not accept his mission.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As to the nature of the kingdom which each of these
two set up, the One in His last words to His disciples on
the night of His sacrifice said, <span class="tei tei-q">“The kings of the gentiles
lord it over them, and they that have power over them
are called beneficent, but you not so: but he that is the
greatest among you let him become as the younger,
and he that is the leader as he that serveth”</span>. In
accordance with this precept, just as Mohammed was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
preparing to appear as the prophet, the greatest among
Christians took as the symbol of his spiritual rule for
his title, Servant of the servants of God: and so Chalid,
the chief fighter, under Mohammed, Abu Bekr, and
Omar, was termed <span class="tei tei-q">“the sword of the swords of God”</span>.
The prophet in the Sura proclaiming his religion pronounced
force to be the instrument of spreading it, and
in doing this blood was to be shed like water: and from
his time his chalifs have practised the slaughter of as
many as they chose. Nor is this confined to enemies,
but his religion has considered his own subjects thus
slaughtered as witnesses of the prophet's claim. To be
killed by order of the chalif is to the believer a title of
honour, and the sacrifice of so many a day to his order
a sacrifice to his religion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The pretension put forward by Mohammed in the
ninth Sura has been fully accepted by his people from
the beginning. He is their apostle, and accordingly
from his life they have taken and woven into their
own in every age the employment of force, the imposture
of a man's invention put in an angel's name,
the right to take away life at the pleasure of the ruler,
but above all, polygamy and concubinage. The sensual
life of Mohammed began exactly at the time when, discarding
persuasion as the instrument of converting
unbelievers, he began to propagate by force his pretended
mission as a prophet. The deterioration in the
moral life coincides with the time when he passed from
the character of one who sought to restore the religion
of Abraham to the very different character of one who
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sought to introduce a new and universal religion.
Moreover, this sensual life of the founder has likewise
infected with a moral pestilence all those parts of
Asia, Africa and Europe, wherein his followers have
prevailed. The man who from fifty to sixty years of
age was multiplying young wives, moving them to
jealousy with a slave concubine, seizing the wife of
an adopted son, in virtue of a feigned divine decree,
and making a special license to himself as the prophet
of God to marry as many wives as he pleased, and
whose wives he pleased, has corrupted all the generations
of those who profess his religion. But more than
in any others this corruption is apparent in those who
rule in the prophet's name. Omar, Osman, and Ali,
the second, third, and fourth chalifs, followed Mohammed
closely in this corruption of domestic life. Ali, the
husband of his favourite daughter, equalled her father
in his wives, as likewise Osman, the husband of another
daughter. Every Mohammedan prince, as a rule, follows
the founder of his dynasty and creed, and thus, as the
race of the Virgin Mother reproduces in every age the
example of her whom all generations call blessed, and
her Divine Son has planted in her the tree of chastity,
of which He is Himself the first fruit, and which
takes root in an honourable people, and as every work
of superhuman charity grows upon that tree, and the
sex lost in Eve is glorified by Mary, so the Mohammedan
line is equally true to its origin. To the very end of
the long night of heathenism, on which the coming of
our Lord dawned, monogamy still survived in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
noblest descendants of Eve. The German had it and
the Roman, and there were ages in which those races,
heathen though they were, honoured woman, and maintained
the sanctity of marriage, before it was exalted
into a sacrament, and before the foundation of human
society was consecrated by the blessing of the Redeemer,
given in the touch of His Blood. The degradation of
woman in every age and every people during the 1250
years of Mohammedan domination, is the special stamp
of the various peoples who have borne his name. I take
the example highest in position and worst in character.
To the precept of Mohammed, enforced by his own
conduct, we owe it that in Constantine's own city the
very chalif who represents him continues without
marriage to practise an unbounded concubinage. Thus
from generation to generation the race of Othman—which
can scarcely be called a family—has been continued,
and enabled to reign over the fairest countries
of the globe, Christian during many hundred years,
for a period almost as long as the long descended lines
of Capet and Hapsburg have subsisted in honourable
marriage. Concubinage has provided it with children,
and fratricide has prevented rivals down to the time of
Sultan Mahmoud. When he succeeded to the throne,
stained in every generation with such crimes, he was
the only survivor of his race. Out of the previous
history a Turkish annalist<a id="noteref_100" name="noteref_100" href="#note_100"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">100</span></span></a> records without astonishment,
for it was an ordinary incident, that in a tumult which
had taken place at the funeral of Sultan Murad III.,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nineteen brothers of the Sultan Mohammed III., all
innocent and guiltless, were strangled and added to the
company of martyrs. From the life of Mohammed
himself has sprung a despotism without limit, a cruelty
which scorns natural affection, and a sensuality without
example.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the personal life on earth of the Son of God is seen
in the religion which He planted, and in the history of
the people which He formed and maintains, so the personal
life of the man Mohammed is seen in the religion
which bears his name, and in the people which have
carried it on. It is only to elucidate this thought that I
have selected these particulars of the Arabian's life, and
as a prelude to the contrast which the religions themselves
present.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A few months after his return from the great pilgrimage
to Mecca in 632, Mohammed was preparing a third
campaign against the Byzantines, which however could
only be executed after his death. A word must be said
as to his exact position at the moment of his death.
In the ten years which follow immediately the Hegira,
the original camel driver, who became husband of
Chadidja, and lived with her virtuously to her death,
pursued the life of a freebooter, which had many alternations
of failure and success. In his character of
prophet, <span class="tei tei-q">“the apostle of God,”</span> he aimed at material
power, and scrupled not to pursue it by deceit, robbery,
and murder, all exercised as means of converting men to
the worship of one God, the almighty and <span class="tei tei-q">“most
merciful”</span>. He had fifteen months before his death so
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
far prevailed as to obtain mastery over the city which he
had left as a fugitive. It was in a certain sense the
capital of Arabia, and he was claiming and in a great
degree receiving the homage of all Arabians. But other
men who also called themselves prophets, such as
Moseilama, were his rivals. The subjection of Arabia
was by no means complete at the time of his death.
The German historian—himself of the Jewish race and
religion—from whose careful study of Mohammedan
writers I have taken many of the incidents above
recorded, says that with the exception of his weakness
in his relations to the female sex, in regard to which
he claimed the privileges allowed to him as a special
favour from God, he gave a fair example to his people.
There was the greatest simplicity as to his dwelling, his
clothing, and his food. He was so unassuming that he
not only refused every external mark of honour from
his companions, but declined every service even from his
slaves which he could perform himself. He was often seen
in the market place buying food, mending his clothes in
a miserable little room, or milking a goat in his court.
Every one could approach him at all hours, whether in
the street or in his dwelling. He visited all the sick,
and showed sympathy to every sufferer, and was also
magnanimous and indulgent where policy did not otherwise
require. His generosity and benevolence, and also
his care for the common good were boundless, so that
in spite of the many presents which he received from all
sides, and the rich plunder which came to him from his
wars, he left little property behind him, and treated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
even this as belonging to the State. After his death it was
not given to his daughter Fatima, his only heiress, the
wife of Ali. He had other sons and daughters besides
Fatima, on the number of whom tradition varies. They
all died before him. We may name only Rukejja and
Umm Kolthum, whom the future Chalif Osman successively
espoused, both by his first wife Chadidja; and
also Ibrahim son of the Coptic slave Mariam, whose
early death the prophet sorely lamented. But this
historian treats the bringing in the Angel Gabriel as the
bearer of his revelations to have been a deceit throughout.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The power which Mohammed claimed rested entirely
on the truth of his assertion that God had committed
to him a prophetical office, carrying with it the
promulgation of a new and universal religion. The
absolute falsehood of this assertion is contained in the
invention of the Angel Gabriel. The Jewish historian
whom I have quoted fully admits this imposture, just as
St. John Damascene made it a reproach a hundred years
after Mohammed's time. The virtues above mentioned,
what are they but the beautiful spots of the tiger's skin
veiling the ferocity of the beast? Mohammed by the
confession of his friends would appear to have had two
intense passions, one for sweet odours, the other for
women. Thalebi commenting on the 5th Sura records
how ten zealous disciples used often to meet and pray
in the house of Osman.<a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101" href="#note_101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">101</span></span></a> They watched through the
night and had resolved to prepare themselves for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
paradise by chastity and mortification. Mohammed did
not approve of it, and preached to the people that it
was no way his mind that those who professed Islam
should abstain, like Christian priests and religious,
from women and from eating flesh, and from sweet
odours; should debar themselves from sleep, and
practice hardships. Fighting was his monkhood.
Abulfeda says he openly confessed as to himself, <span class="tei tei-q">“Two
things attract me and carry me away: women and
sweet odours. My joy is in these two pleasures, and
they make me more prayerful.”</span> In fact Mohammed
was never so pious as when he took a new wife; while
he deserted them all for the Coptic slave-girl Mariam.
And the Koran told him that he was right.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What were pharisaic prayings in the market place to
the devotions of Mohammed? He called upon all with
whom he came in contact to accept the one God, and
Mohammed as his prophet, on pain of being exterminated,
and he delivered up to the pleasure of the Mohammedan
fighter as many female captives as any one could take,
over and above the four wives whom he allowed to all.
These captives were not the victims of angry passions in
men maddened by a furious conflict, but the avowed and
justified reward of those who might, if slain in battle,
have been martyrs, but instead were victorious. The
very worst corruption<a id="noteref_102" name="noteref_102" href="#note_102"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">102</span></span></a> which we meet with in the idol
worship and demon worship of Greeks and Romans was
the shamelessness which pandered to all lusts of the flesh
under cover of religion. But Mohammed added to this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
corruption. In virtue of his Koran the most infamous
passions were allowed not in belief of false gods, themselves
models of impurity, but in worshipping the one
holy God. In all this the example as well as the word
of the religious founder had gone before, and his people
followed it from age to age.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mohammed then at the time of his death was a
successful robber in a country wherein the tribal life
was in a state of great confusion and incessant changes,
and the ancestral religion had degenerated into a rude
and senseless idolatry. The race which occupied
Arabia—the whole people which claimed Ishmael the
son of Abraham for their ancestor—was devoid of order
and of culture, of art or science, and had not affected
the history of the world beyond its own boundaries.
That the lord of Byzantium on the one hand or the lord
of Ctesiphon on the other contemplated permanent
danger to their realms from the incursions of such a race
can as little be supposed as that Europe now is in fear
of subjugation from a host of Caffres or Zulus, people, in
personal bravery, resolution and bodily strength, equal
probably to what the Saracens then were.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Omar's chalifate<a id="noteref_103" name="noteref_103" href="#note_103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">103</span></span></a> he had sent an army of 30,000
men, under one of Mohammed's eldest companions,
to compel the Persians on the Euphrates to become
Mohammedans. They had placed themselves under
the last heir of the royal race, the young and valiant
Jezdejerd. When the embassy requiring them to
accept Islam or tribute came, the heir of the great
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
king said to them mockingly: <span class="tei tei-q">“You came hither as
traffickers and beggars. Your food was green lizards;
your drink salt water; your dress rough camel's hair.
Now you would force upon us a hateful religion.
Hunger pushes you on; so I forgive you. Go back
and I will load your camels with corn and dates. If
you disdain a generous offer, punishment shall find you
in Persia.”</span> Then the old sheick Mughira answered
undismayed: <span class="tei tei-q">“What thou sayest of our misery is true.
So great was our poverty that we fed on worms, snakes,
and scorpions. The hair of our camels and our goats we
worked into a covering for our nakedness. Our faith
consisted in perpetual war and robbery. We put even
our daughters to death to escape supporting them.
Then God took pity on our miserable state, and sent us
through His holy prophet the book of the true faith.
It commands us to make war against the heathen, to
change our poverty and our misery for riches and
power. Take then our religion which binds you to no
other burdens than all the faithful bear. Or pay the
tribute of the heathen. Will you do neither, arm
yourselves to fight.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such was the people among whom Mohammed arose.
The spirit which he wakened speaks in the words of the
poetess Chansa, with which she sent her four sons to
battle. <span class="tei tei-q">“By God, the only one, ye are the sons of a
man as ye are the sons of a woman. I have not deceived
your father; I have not brought your uncle to shame,
nor stained your race. Ye know what rich reward God
has promised to Moslim for war against the unbelieving.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Bethink you that the eternal dwelling is better than this
place of sojourn.”</span> All her four sons fell in battle.
Chansa cried: <span class="tei tei-q">“Praise be to the Lord who has made me
a name through the martyr-death of my sons”</span>. The
words of this mother breathe the whole spirit which made
Islam a conquering power.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mohammed had died without leaving any indication
as to whom he wished for his successor. His chief
adherents, Abu Bekr, father of his wife Aischa, in
whose residence he had died, his sons-in-law Ali and
Omar, with their several parties, met together. Omar
put aside his own claims, and had influence sufficient to
procure the election of Abu Bekr, and to frustrate that
of Ali. Severe as the struggle to obtain the chalifate
was, at the moment it brought with it greater burden
than dignity.<a id="noteref_104" name="noteref_104" href="#note_104"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">104</span></span></a> Mohammed had spread his belief more
by bribery, deceit, and violence than by conviction.
Many provinces of Arabia after his death were shaking
it off. Aischa's own words were, <span class="tei tei-q">“when the apostle of
God died, the Arabs were deserting him; the Jews and
Christians raised their head; the hypocrites no longer
concealed their hypocrisy, and the Moslim were like an
abandoned flock on a cold winter night”</span>. Abu Bekr's
prudence and Omar's energy put an end to the rivalry
of pretending prophets and Bedouin reluctance of taxation.
In March, 633, revolt in Arabia was overthrown,
and the first chalif could execute the injunction of
Mohammed to spread Islam beyond the Arabian peninsula.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The choice of a chalif not in the family of Mohammed
to carry on his newly made realm and religion with
armed hand was of the utmost moment to both. In
idea realm and religion were one and the same thing.
And the choice indicated that force was the power
which ruled both. Abu Bekr had not only been chosen
by the influence of Omar, but during his short chalifate
of two years had that most resolute of all Mohammed's
companions behind him to support, inspire, and perhaps
control him. When the companions met upon his death
in 634 Omar's star was in the ascendant; and in the
ten years of his chalifate he won in the opinion of his
people the highest name which any Mohammedan ruler
has attained. In truth, he made the empire. At the
first choice of Abu Bekr for chalif it was but a horde of
robbers in a province hitherto without name in history;
when twelve years later Omar died by the hand of an
assassin, it already rivalled the greatest empires of the
world. To feel the profound contrast between the
kingdom of Christ and the kingdom of Mohammed, we
need but to consider the course of the first twelve years
from the death of each founder. When the sword of
Herod fell upon St. James, the son of thunder, the first
of the apostles who was to seal his faith with his blood,
and so fulfil his acceptance of his Lord's chalice, the
kingdom of Christ had been preached among labours
and trials innumerable. No one had yielded submission
to it but in obedience to the inward dictate of conscience,
and every one who so accepted it had suffered loss so
far as this world is concerned. It was from imminent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
peril of death that when St. James, probably then the
second in rank and influence of the apostolic band, was
put to death, the first of all escaped from prison under
angelic guard and went into another place to found the
Roman Church. A martyrdom undergone by one
apostle and a martyrdom postponed by another marked
the setting up of St. Peter's pastoral staff in the capital
of the Cæsars. The Christian people were everywhere
then a poor, distressed, and praying people; hardly
distinguished by the imperial Roman from the provincials
of Judea, whom among all his subjects he most
disliked. When Omar died, Antioch, Jerusalem, and
Alexandria had fallen beneath his arms; the sepulchre
of Christ was in his power; the patriarch of the holy
city trembled lest the chalif of Mohammed should
desecrate it to be a mosque by praying in it. Every
Mohammedan convert received honour and wealth;
everyone not converted to Mohammedanism risked
honour and life, wife and child. The Christian martyr
shed his blood on the scaffold; the Mohammedan martyr
died in the heat of battle, and his companions received
for the danger which they had risked and overcome the
persons and goods of the conquered. Omar's empire
stretched for thousands of miles over Africa and Asia;
his authority was that of the prophet, who wielded civil
power as an appendage of the spiritual, because, as he
held, there could not be two swords in one sheath.
The chief apostle exercised one of the greatest of his
acts—that of choosing the capital of the Christian faith—when
he was flying from a tyrant put in Jerusalem
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by the caprice of a Roman emperor. The arms were
spiritual in one kingdom and material in the other;
exercised with the long suffering of an apostle in one,
with the unquestioned despotism in the other of a ruler
who triumphed over souls by destroying bodies. The
fundamental opposition which marks the two kingdoms
is seen in strongest evidence during the first twelve
years in each.

Hitherto, in human history, there is one man and one
man only, who has matched himself with the Son of
God: and not only matched himself, but declared that
he was the superior; that the commission given to the
Son of Mary was subordinate to the commission given
to the Son of Abd Allah: that the prophet Jesus led up
to the prophet Mohammed. It is certain that in the
Mohammedan religion its prophet occupies the place
which in the Christian religion is occupied by our
Lord. But when this is said, it must be said with the
understanding that <span class="tei tei-q">“Mohammed's religion is a Judaism

a series of prophets, the last and greatest of whom is
Mohammed himself. He has denied the Blessed Trinity:
he has termed the honour paid by Christians to the Son,
idolatry; he ranks Christians as idolaters for offering it,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as being incompatible with the unity of God. He
denies the Incarnation on the Arian ground, that it is
impossible for the one only Nature to generate or be
generated. He has denied the fall of man, equally as
he denies his restoration. He denies the passion of
Christ, for unfallen man needs no such sacrifice as that
of the Son of God offered upon the Cross. In the
system set up by him there is no sacrifice. In that
point of singular meaning it stands alone among the
religions of the earth. Accordingly there is no priesthood.
Mohammed claimed to exercise the prophetical
and in it the regal power; but not the sacerdotal.
There is none such in his religion. Such as it is,
on an infinitely lower level than the Christian,
Mohammed is the centre of it. From the Jewish
and the Christian religions he took prayer, fasting,
and almsgiving, likewise the doctrines of primary
import, the unity of the godhead, the resurrection of
man in body as well as spirit, to a final and eternal
judgment of reward or punishment. That which came
from himself is purely bad; a corruption affecting all
the relations between the sexes, and reducing all those
who live in his religion to a far worse condition, as
respects those relations, than experienced by those who
lived in Greek, or Roman, or German heathenism, at their
worst. As the personal life of Mohammed, from the
time of his claim to be the prophet of a new religion,
was in this respect infamous, so is his religion. All
that the Christian faith and Church, by the sufferings
of unnumbered martyrs, and the wisdom of great pastors,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
who are the honour of human nature, had done in 600
years for the restoration of marriage, the creation of
woman's worth and dignity, the whole fabric of the
Christian home, the whole offspring of Nazareth, Bethlehem,
and Calvary, Mohammed, by word and example,
strove to overthrow. He embodied in his religion the
revenge of Asia and Africa upon Christian purity: and
the hand which established a pure Arian doctrine, as to
the Godhead, destroyed the Christian wife and child,
husband and father, so far as its malignant influence
extended. So it was at the beginning: so it has been
through the 1260 years: so it is now.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The whole movement of Mohammed was to establish
a counter kingdom to that of Christ, of which he who
lived as a sensualist from fifty to sixty years of age is
the standard. His chalifs were its continuators. And
while his instrument was conquest, the bait which keeps
each successive generation, and defies the approach of
the Christian faith, is the indulgence of those sensual
enjoyments which marked the life of the founder from
the time of the Flight, which has equally marked the
conduct of the ruler and the rich during all the twelve
centuries. The Mohammedan peasant may have a
virtuous home, for the harem is beyond his means:
he may be sparing, sober, and honest: but where is
the Mohammedan ruler or rich man whose inner life
will bear inspection? As Roman law stopped before
entering the slave apartment, Mohammedan law stops
before entering the women's apartment: while the mark
of the chalifs supreme dignity is to have no wife, but
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
concubines, in the very words of St. John Damascene,
a thousand if he please. Has any false religion ever
shown such a mark of imposture? or is any opposition
to the Son of God so deep as this, so universal in its
effect upon the whole character?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
About a hundred years after the time of Mohammed
there lived at the court of the chalif of Damascus the
man who ranks as the last great Father of the eastern
Church: who, indeed, anticipated in some degree in
that Church the position afterwards held by St. Thomas
Aquinas, in the West.<a id="noteref_106" name="noteref_106" href="#note_106"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">106</span></span></a> His father, Sergius, though a
fervent Christian, held high office in the Syrian court.
He purchased and set free captive Christians, and among
them was a Thalian monk, named Cosmas, learned in
theology and philosophy. Cosmas became teacher of
his benefactor's son, John: and gave him such an
education, that upon the death of his father the chalif
made him one of the chiefs of his council, while Peter,
bishop of Damascus, charged him to defend by writings
the Christian truth against unbelievers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He must have known well the religion of the chalif,
in whose court he was a high officer. He thus speaks
of Mohammed. <span class="tei tei-q">“Down to the time of Heraclius the
Saracens were avowed idolaters. Afterwards a false
prophet arose among them, named Mamed. He lighted
upon the Old and New Testament, and as the result of
confabulations with a certain Arian monk constructed
a heresy of his own. He gained by the appearance of
piety influence with his people, and pretended that a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Scripture was brought down to him from heaven.
Having put together in his book certain most absurd
statements, he delivered to them a worship.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He says there is one God, the Creator of all things,
who is neither begotten nor begetting. He says that
Christ is the Word and Spirit of God, a creature and a
servant: and that He was born without a father from
Mary, the sister of Moses and Aaron. For, says he, the
Word and Spirit of God entered Mary, and she bore
Jesus a prophet and servant of God. The Jews wickedly
wished to crucify Him: they seized and crucified His
shadow. But Christ Himself, he says, was not crucified,
nor did He die. For God took Him to Himself
into Heaven, for He loved Him. And this, he says,
that when Christ ascended into Heaven, God asked
Him: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Jesus, didst Thou say, I am the Son of God,
and God?’</span> And he says, Jesus answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Lord, pardon
me. Thou knowest that I never said it, nor am too
proud to be Thy servant. But men that were transgressors
wrote it, that I said this word, and they lied
against Me, and are in error’</span>. And God answered and
said to Him: <span class="tei tei-q">‘I know that Thou didst not say this
word’</span>. Now he said many other portentous and
ridiculous things in this Scripture of his, which he
pretends to have been sent down to him from God.
Now when we allege, who is the witness that God gave
him a Scripture? Which of the prophets foretold that
such a prophet was to arise? Moses received the law
from God in the sight of all the people, when he
appeared on Mount Sinai, in cloud, and fire, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
darkness, and storm. And all the prophets from Moses
onwards foretold the coming of Christ, and that Christ
is God, and that the Son of God would come in the
flesh, and would be crucified, and die, and rise again,
and that He is the Judge of the living and the dead.
And when we ask, why did not your prophet come so,
others bearing witness to him. Why did not God, as
He gave the law to Moses in the sight of the people on
the smoking mountain, give the Scripture which you
speak of to him in your presence, that you also may be
assured. They answer, God does what He will. We
reply, that we know well. But we ask how the Scripture
came down to your prophet. And they answer,
the Scripture came down upon him when he was
sleeping.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Again we ask, how is it, when in this Scripture of
yours he enjoined to do nothing, and to receive nothing
without witnesses, that you did not ask him, first show
by witnesses that you are a prophet, and have come
forth from God, and what Scripture bears witness to
you? They are mute through shame. Since you may
not marry without witnesses, nor market, nor possess,
nor take an ass or beast of burden without witness.
Wives, indeed, you have, and possessions, and asses,
and all the rest through witnesses. Faith alone and
Scripture you have without a witness. He who gave
you this has no security whatever. No witness preceding
him is known: but he received it asleep. They
call us associators, because we bring in an associate to
God, when we say that Christ is the Son of God, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
God. We reply, prophets and Scripture have handed
this down to us. You, as you assert, acknowledge
prophets. If we are wrong in saying that Christ is
Son of God, it is they who have taught it and delivered
it to us.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The objection here made in general, that Mohammed
had no witness to his mission, and none to the assertion
that his Scripture came from God, has received no
answer. Indeed, not only is there no witness that
the Koran was given by God, or by the agency of the
prophet Gabriel, but the condition in which it was left
by Mohammed at his death supplies the strongest
internal evidence that the Scripture was an imposture.
This is the account given by the historian of the present
day, who has used thirty years of his life to study, and
compare Mohammedan writers on their prophet.<a id="noteref_107" name="noteref_107" href="#note_107"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">107</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Koran is the Arabic name for the Mohammedan
Bible, or collection of discourses held by Mohammed in
the name of God, in his quality as inspired prophet,
which, as he asserts, were partly communicated through
the angel Gabriel, partly revealed to him immediately
by God through dreams or visions. But the Koran is
not, like the Bible, a book drawn up in chronological
order, or according to the variety of its contents, but a
mixing up of hymns, prayers, dogmas, sermons, casual
writings, narratives, legends, laws, and orders of the
day, with many repetitions and contradictions. This
comes because Mohammed himself made no collection
of the revelations given singly to him during a course
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of twenty-three years. It is probable that it was not
even his wish that all of them should be kept, since
a great number of them had only a transitory meaning.
Likewise he had undertaken so many alterations in his
doctrines and laws that he had reason to shrink from
handing them all down to posterity. In fine he certainly
wished to retain up to his death free room for
modifications and additions which might be necessary.
But after his death all fragments of the revelation were
thrown together, even when they had been repealed by
others, or were already issued in different form. All
portions of the Koran, scattered in different hands,
inscribed on parchment, palm-leaves, bones, stones, or
other rough materials for writing, were collected—or
even such as lived only in the remembrance of his
companions and disciples—and were divided, mostly
without regard to their contents, or the time at which
they had been revealed, into greater or smaller chapters,
Suras; and thus the actual Koran, with all its defects,
was made. It is only by an accurate knowledge of the
circumstances of Mohammed's life, and the language of
the Koran, in some degree possible to restore the
chronological order of its several parts. By the help of
Mohammed's Arabian biographers, some of whom go
back so far as the second century of the Mohammedan
era, it is possible to determine the date of such sections
as relate to historical events. Where this is not the
case, the character and form of the revelation serve to
direct. Mohammed in his first time appears more as a
reformer, later as the founder of a new religion, at last
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as prince and legislator. In the first period he was
carried away by inward enthusiasm: his language has a
rhythmical movement, with true poetic colouring. In
the second period a calmer consideration takes the place
of excited fancy; he is more rhetorician than poet: his
words spring rather from an understanding wide awake,
not sparkling, as before, with warmth of heart. In the
third period the language sinks to sober prose, not only
in ordaining laws, issuing injunctions, or narrating campaigns,
but when he paints, as before, God's Almightiness,
the wonders of creation, the terrors of the last
judgment, or the joys of paradise.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Koran was first collected by the chalif Aim Bekr.
This collection is said to have been occasioned by the
death of many acquainted with the Koran in the war
against the rival prophet, Moseilama, and the fear that
there would soon no longer be men who had learnt it
by heart and understood it. A certain Zeid who had
served the prophet as secretary was charged to collect
the revelations, and when he had completed his work,
he gave it over to the chalif, from whose hand after his
death it passed into that of his successor, Omar. Omar
left it to his daughter Hafsah, widow of Mohammed.
Zeid's work aimed merely at providing a copy of all the
scattered fragments. No thought seems as yet to have
been taken to arrange them in order or to divide them
into chapters. This collection had as yet no public
authority, for other fragments were in circulation, which
varied from it more or less, so that there were often
disputations about the true reading of particular passages.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
To meet this state of things, so dangerous to
the unity of the faith and the law, Chalif Osman caused
a new edition of the Koran to be prepared. The collection
made by Abu Bekr formed the basis of this.
Osman sent copies of this edition to the chief cities of
the subject provinces, and caused all versions varying
from it to be destroyed. The division of the Koran
into 114 chapters dates from Osman. In this, however,
as above remarked, neither subject nor order of time
was sufficiently considered. The sequence was generally
determined by the size of the chapters, the larger
being put at the head, and the smaller at the close.
The Koran of Osman now stood for the ground text of
the divine revelation. If later further copies led to
variations of the text, they spring from the incompleteness
of the Kufish writing, which continued in use for
several hundred years. In this not only were the vowel
marks wanting, but the diacritic points which served to
distinguish from each other several similar letters.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Koran contains subjects of highly mixed character.
It embraces not only the whole doctrine and
legislation of Mohammed, but likewise a considerable
portion of his life, of his mental and material struggles,
as well as the history of prophets preceding him, and
the legends concerning them.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus in the year 632 a robber who was compelling
the whole Arabian people to submit to his authority had
somewhat suddenly died. His companions, robbers like
himself, met together after his death. They proclaimed
the dead chieftain <span class="tei tei-q">“to be supreme teacher of religion,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and, in that capacity, law-giver over the whole extent
of the social, civil, and political domain”</span>.<a id="noteref_108" name="noteref_108" href="#note_108"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">108</span></span></a> They elected
one of themselves to continue this authority by the
name of chalif, or successor. In this act I note four
things. The successor is not taken out of Mohammed's
family, but by free choice of the faithful. Secondly, he
is chosen as a spiritual head: but this headship carries
in itself the whole temporal power. Thirdly, the place
of Mohammed among his own faithful, corresponds to
the place of Christ in his Church, if we bear in mind all
the differences which distinguish the two communities.
Fourthly, the chalif in the Mohammedan community
corresponds to the Pope in the Christian. He is the
successor of Mohammed, God's Apostle, as the Pope is
the successor of St. Peter. The chalif is the bearer of
Mohammedanism, as Mohammed's vicegerent: the Pope
is the bearer of Christendom, as the vicegerent of
Christ, and the spiritual Peter. As Christ and
Mohammed answer to each other in religions radically
antagonistic to each other, so Pope answers to chalif,
with the same requisite differences.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is to be noted that Christendom and Islam coincide
as to the time of their rise. A Catholic Church there
had been through all the six preceding centuries. But
the allegiance of different bodies politic to one Christian
faith and legislation was only beginning when Mohammed
arose. The various kingdoms which the Teuton
races were forming in all the countries of the West drew
their common spiritual life from the Pope in Rome.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The eastern emperor was becoming one of many sovereigns
who acknowledged the authority of Peter. If
Heraclius thought himself to wield the one sovereignty
displayed by Justinian, he was undeceived before
his death. If his grandson kidnapped a Pope out of his
Lateran Church and Palace, and then martyred him as
a traitor to his absolute power, the isles of the West
were looking upon him at the same time as the bestower
to them of the Christian faith, and of all the blessings
which that faith brought with it to their civil life.
St. Wilfrid spoke to the Northumbrian king concerning
the doorkeeper of the kingdom of heaven. The king
listened and obeyed. Thus the roots of Christendom
were sprouting in France and Spain and Britain at the
moment that Omar guided the suffrages of Mohammed's
companions to choose the aged Abu Bekr for his successor.
From that time these powers are formed over
against each other in perpetual contrast and antagonism.
The union of the two powers in Islam becomes the centre
of a complete despotism. The distinction of the two
powers in Christendom—which Pope Gelasius had
marked with so much emphasis to the encroaching
emperor Anastasius a hundred and forty years before—which
St. Martin exercised at the cost of his life in the
time of the third chalif—was the pledge and guarantee
to Christendom of authority, supreme but temperate, of
spiritual rule protecting civil liberty. A long succession
of Popes—at the mercy of eastern despots as to
civil matters—maintain their spiritual independence and
their guidance of that new assemblage of nations in a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
common Christendom through the terrible seventh century.
At the same moment Northern Africa, and Egypt,
and Syria fall passively into the hands of the chalifate,
and Byzantium loses the half of its power and trembles
for its own existence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How vast in its importance for future ages the establishment
of the chalifate upon the death of Mohammed
was, may be seen from the following considerations.<a id="noteref_109" name="noteref_109" href="#note_109"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">109</span></span></a> It
cannot be denied that the absolutely despotic form of
government in lands under the sway of Mohammed has
been created by the influence of the religion. It has
indeed often been maintained that the genius of Asiatic
peoples specially produces this form of rule. But states
which are not Mohammedan rest on quite a different
basis: and their rulers are or were subject to great
and essential limitations. A Hindu king who reigned
under the laws of Manu could not break through the
immunities of the Brahmins, or the separation of the
castes. An emperor of China, though he be called the
son of heaven, and his throne be approached only with
forms of the deepest submission, can name no officer
except according to the list of candidates provided by
the learned order. Not so the Princes of the Faithful.
Two elements here concur to produce the most complete
form of despotism: the mixing together or more properly
unification of the spiritual and the temporal power; and
the military power resting on conquest. According as
the theocratic or the military principle prevailed, the
sovereignty would take a distinct colouring: the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
despotism assume a milder or a sterner aspect. When,
as in the case of the Arabian chalifs, and in a certain
degree of the Turkish sultans since Selim, the religious
character prevailed, and the political power, in accordance
with the original spirit of Islam, appeared only as
an issue and endowment of the spiritual, the unconditional
submission would take more of a religious and
conscientious devotedness. Then the dynasty, clothed
in the divinity which hedges a king, could enjoy greater
stability and security: the ruler himself, reminded ever
of his consecrated character, of the duties and the higher
responsibility which lay upon him, would make through
regard for the prescriptions of religion a more moderate
use of an authority in itself unlimited. Where, on the
contrary, the spirit of an arbitrary military lordship prevailed,
as in most of the kingdoms formed after the
overthrow of the chalifate in Central Asia, the blind
obedience of the subject would rather be the result of
fear and custom. An attempt to overthrow the possessor
of supreme power, with the self-same violence by
means of which he had raised himself to it, would
appear at once as allowable and attractive. Thence
would follow more frequent change of dynasty, indifference
to it on the part of the population, continual
suspicion, and tyrannical exercise of even the bloodiest
means to put down every opposing force.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus the government of the Ottoman kingdom did
not take that character of brutal tyranny which marks
the history of Persia. The Persian king is so absolutely
lord of the life and property of his subjects, that a sentence
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
even issued in a drunken revel without the least
formality receives immediate execution. A Persian
proverb truly says: To be near the shah is to be near a
burning fire. The general view that a king is naturally
tyrannical and unjust has passed into the very language,
so that a complainant for the strongest expression of the
wrong which he has suffered says: He played the king
over me. Thus the learned in the law maintain that
the king's commands are superior to the right of nature,
they only yield to a positive divine command. The
lordship of the Ottoman sultans, though resting on the
same principle of unlimited power, appears on the whole
milder and more moderate. Here too, as the founder
of the line declared, all property belongs to the sultan;
here also <span class="tei tei-q">“the slave's neck is thinner than a hair,”</span> and
all subjects rank as the sultan's slaves, and even call
themselves so: here too the sultan's mother calls her
son <span class="tei tei-q">“my lion”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“my tiger,”</span> and Moslim name the
sultan not only <span class="tei tei-q">“the Shadow of God,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“the Refuge
of the World,”</span> but also <span class="tei tei-q">“the Executioner, the Slayer,”</span>
since he alone possesses the absolute right over the life
of all. Turkish doctors ascribe to him also a holy
character not to be effaced by any immorality. If his
actions shew a scorn of all admitted conceptions of
justice or prudence, yet in force of a Mohammedan
fiction it is assumed that he does much or most of this
in consequence of a divine suggestion, and therefore that
his motives can neither be discerned nor judged by men.
In the same spirit the learned in the law maintain that
the sultan can put to death every day fourteen persons,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
without giving reason, or lying under imputation of
tyranny. Whoever receives death without resistance
from his hand or by his order becomes thereby a martyr,
and many of his servants are said to have striven after
the honour of such a death as a secure pledge of eternal
happiness. A tyrannical power such as this as a rule
naturally strikes those only who stand near the throne.
The members of his own family, the higher officers of
state, fall victims to it. The mass of the people seldom
feels such direct effects of their despot. Here the
principle holds, the higher the dignity, the more perfect
the confidence, the greater the danger. The grand
visiers, the other selves of the sultans in temporal
matters have experienced this. A hundred and eighty
statesmen have held this highest office of the kingdom
from 1370 to 1789: most of them therefore scarcely
more than two years. Many have been executed after
a short time. One of the most esteemed Mohammedan
princes, Soliman the Magnificent, executed during his
government, one after the other, most of the men on
whose shoulders he had laid the most important works
and the highest offices of his kingdom. An instinct of
obedience, an inclination to unconditional absolute subjection
under absolute authority prevails among Mohammedans,
to which the utmost cruelty appears endurable,
the utmost perversity natural.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It must be added that the Sultan of Morocco unites
the spiritual, and the temporal power, as sheriff, that is
descendant of the prophet through Hosein and Ali. He
is a despot as absolute as the king of Persia. All depends
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
upon his will. He makes, alters, suppresses, and restores
laws. He changes them according to his humour, convenience,
or interests. Here there is no body of Ulema,
no Mufti clothed with an authority independent of the
sovereign, no divan, colleges, or ministerial departments.
All follows the single command of the ruler.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The nature of the supreme authority in these three
Moslem empires speaks at the present day of its origin
in the person of Mohammed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What we see is this. The misuse of Cæsarean power
in applying to the Church of God, which from the
beginning by divine order was independent, a supremacy
in spiritual things not belonging to the civil ruler, is
allowed by Divine Providence to call forth a far more
terrible despotism, in the guise of a false prophet who invents
a religion of which he is to be the apostle, and then
claims all power, spiritual and temporal, as belonging to
him in the character of apostle, and the use of force as
the means of propagation. That despotism is allowed to
seize for permanent occupation the richest provinces of
the eastern empire, and to make its capital in fear of
perpetual subjection. But it is also used to check the
imperial usurpation over the Church, and to begin an
era, now lasting for twelve centuries and a half, in which
two religions, and two forms of government springing
from these religions, stand over against each other in
perpetual and irreconcilable opposition.

The structure of the Church was vehemently shaken
by the earthquake<a id="noteref_110" name="noteref_110" href="#note_110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">110</span></span></a> which attended the pouring out of

Islam upon the south-eastern and southern countries of

the whole fabric would maintain itself upon its foundation

we had a hundred we should lay waste the world with all

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The hundredth egg has never been granted, but if the
assassin's stroke had not carried off Chalif Omar in 644,
and again Chalif Osman in the year 656, and again
Chalif Ali in the year 661, perhaps the desolation might
have been fully accomplished; as also if the chalifate,
created by election in 632, had not become within
thirty years a mere hereditary kingdom, in which rival
pretenders and rival families exhausted the strength of
Islam by perpetual conflicts. The empire of the sword
has also illustrated the divine decree: <span class="tei tei-q">“All that take
the sword shall perish with the sword”</span>.

The seizure of Pope St. Martin in his Lateran Church
by the exarch of Ravenna, Kalliopas, under order from
the Emperor Constans II., his secret deportation to Constantinople,
his trial before the Senate as guilty of high
treason, his condemnation to death, and subsequent death
in the Crimea from hardship or starvation, with the
election of Pope Eugenius during his lifetime by the
Roman clergy through dread of a Monothelite being
forced upon them by the Byzantine; all this marks
probably the lowest point of civil depression and helplessness
to which the Papacy was ever reduced in those
momentous three centuries which run from Genseric to
Aistulf, from 455 to 755. The emperor who committed
acts so mean, perfidious, and cruel was reigning over an
empire already cut in two by the sword of Mohammed's
chalif. How little he had heeded the chastisement we
learn from an incident in the trial of the great eastern
confessor, St. Maximus, which I have already recorded,
but to which I recur that I may exhibit the full insolence
of the eastern despot, as well as his blindness. Theodosius,
the consul, coming straight out from the emperor's
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cabinet, with the condemnation of Maximus in his hand,
addressed him in these words:<a id="noteref_111" name="noteref_111" href="#note_111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">111</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“Learn, Sir Abbot, that
when we get a little relief from this rout of heathens
(that is, of the Saracens who had stripped Constans of
Syria, Egypt, Mesopotamia, and North Africa as far as
Kairowan), by the Holy Trinity we will bring you to
terms, and your Pope, who is now lifted up, and all the
talkers there, and the rest of your disciples; and we will
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cook</span></em> you all, each in his own place, as Martin has been
cooked”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These words were spoken on the 14th December, 656.<a id="noteref_112" name="noteref_112" href="#note_112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">112</span></span></a> The Pope Eugenius was the Pope alluded to in them,
and it is inferred from them that he rejected those terms
of union which the emperor was seeking to impose and
which the nuntios were willing to accept. The martyrdom
of St. Martin had taken place on the 16th September of
the preceding year, 655.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was the providence of God that the chalif himself
never allowed the sworn protector of the Church who
sat on the eastern throne to execute this threat. Rather
he was all through this century in dread lest the
Mohammedan, having fixed his throne at Damascus,
should advance it to Constantinople. It was again the
providence of God that Constantinople itself should not
fall during this time of its utmost weakness, and so open
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the whole of northern Europe to Mohammedan domination.
The city of Constantine was then the material
rampart which stopped the impetuous current of Saracen
invasion to the north. The chalif Muawiah, who
reigned over the immense Saracen empire from 661 to
680, was strong enough continually to beat the Emperor,
to ravage his Asiatic territory, to advance towards his
capital, but he was never able to take it. The advance
of the seat of the Saracenic empire from the remote
Medina to the near and beautiful Damascus, the paradise
of eastern cities, dwelling in its perpetual garden among
ever-flowing waters of Abana and Pharpar, was itself a
sign how the empire had fallen. A religion founded
on the denial of the Christian faith, of which it was,
moreover, the special rival, had full possession of the
once Roman and Christian East. Muawiah became
chalif on the death of Ali in 661. He had conducted
the civil war against Ali, which distracted for five years
the Saracen power, with the forces of Syria, as its
governor; and when he became supreme made it the
capital of his empire.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Constans II., having crowned with martyrdom the
greatest confessor of the West, Pope Martin, and the
greatest confessor of the East, St. Maximus, resolved in
the year 662, to visit the West. The tyranny
of Constans in regard to the Pope was not completed
even by his treatment of St Martin. When
he had condemned this Pope, but before he had caused
his death he is supposed to have compelled the Roman
clergy to elect another Pope. This was Eugenius, who
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was recognised in the year 654 for Pope, while St.
Martin was yet alive.<a id="noteref_113" name="noteref_113" href="#note_113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">113</span></span></a> Whether the urgency and threats
of the imperial ministers overcame at length the constancy
of the clergy, or whether, as is more probable,
they feared to see some heretic sent by the emperor to
occupy the throne of St. Peter, they elected Eugenius,
by birth a Roman, a person of great goodness and holy
life, who held the See two years and eight months. The
synodical letter of Peter, the fourth Monothelite
patriarch of Constantinople in succession was sent to
him, but being obscure in its expressions about our
Lord, was sent back with indignity.<a id="noteref_114" name="noteref_114" href="#note_114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">114</span></span></a> It would seem
that the exceeding danger of the time caused the election
and consecration of Pope Eugenius in the lifetime
of St. Martin, to pass for legitimate. Eugenius died in
657, and was succeeded by Pope Vitalian, after a vacancy
of a month and 29 days.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pope Eugenius had not acknowledged either of the
patriarchs Paulus or Peter by writing to them, but
Vitalian sent his nuntios to Constans to announce his
accession to the papacy by his synodical letter. Constans
received them graciously, acknowledged the
privileges of the Roman Church, and sent by them to
St. Peter at Rome a copy of the gospels bound in golden
covers and studded with diamonds. Vitalian, says
Anastasius, preserved in all respects the ecclesiastical
rule and vigour.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Constans had a brother named Theodosius, whom he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
forced to become a deacon, and he had repeatedly
received from his hands the chalice of the Lord's Blood.
Afterwards he caused him to be murdered. He was
said to have often dreamt of his victim, offering him a
chalice full of blood, with the words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Brother, drink”</span>.
The stings of conscience and the hatred of the people
for his cruelty and his protection of heresy, were supposed
to drive him from his capital.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The book of the Popes under its notice of the life of
Vitalian says:<a id="noteref_115" name="noteref_115" href="#note_115"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">115</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“In his time the emperor came from the
royal city by coast to Athens, thence to Tarentum,
Beneventum, and Naples. At Rome he arrived on the 5th
July. The Apostolical went out with his clergy to the
sixth milestone from the city to receive him. The same
day the emperor went to pray at St. Peter's, and offered
his gift. On Saturday he went to St. Mary's and also
offered his gift. On Sunday he went in procession
with his army to St. Peter's. All went out with wax
candles to meet him, and he offered on the altar a golden
woven pall, and Mass was celebrated. Again on Saturday
the emperor came to the Lateran, took a bath, and
dined in the Julian basilica. On Sunday there was a
station at St. Peter's, and after celebration of Mass the
emperor and the pontiff took leave of each other.
Twelve days he remained in the Roman city. Every
bronze statue which ornamented the city he took down,
nay, and he unroofed of its brazen tiles the Church of
Blessed Mary at the Martyrs, and sent all things which
he had taken to the royal city. Then on Monday he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
left Rome and returned to Naples. Then he went by
land to Rhegium and entered Sicily. He lived in the
city of Syracuse, and caused much affliction to the
people, the inhabitants or proprietors of Calabria, Sicily,
Africa, and Sardinia, by his exactions during many
years such as had never been.<a id="noteref_116" name="noteref_116" href="#note_116"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">116</span></span></a> He separated even wives
from their husbands, and sons from their fathers, and
they suffered many other unheard of things, so that a
man had not hope of life. They took even the sacred
vessels and ornaments of God's holy churches, and left
nothing.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The visit of Constans to Rome casts a strong light
upon the condition of things in a century concerning
which we are singularly destitute of detailed information.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When Constans landed with a certain force at Tarentum,
he found the Lombards in possession of the duchy
of Beneventum. A legend said that their king Autharis
after a bold march through the Peninsula to the Straits
of Messina, had spurred his horse into the sea and exclaimed,
<span class="tei tei-q">“This shall be the Lombard boundary”</span>. But
his successors had never made good the words of
Autharis. Naples and Amalfi, Sorrentum, Gaeta, and
Tarentum had imperial governors. Alboin however
made a duchy of Beneventum which then included the
ancient Samnium and Apulia, and portions of Campania
and Lucania. It was a stronghold of Lombard robbers
in southern Italy. Constans tried to expel the young
duke Romuald. But he failed, and hearing that King
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Grimoald was approaching to aid his son, he went to
Naples, left at Formiæ, the present Mola di Gaeta, 20,000
men, and marched on Rome by the Appian Way.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pope Vitalian went out to meet him as legitimate
Roman emperor. It was true that ten years before he
had seized Pope St. Martin in his church, and carried
him off by stealth to trial, suffering, and ultimate
martyrdom in the Crimea. It was true likewise that
while holding St. Martin in prison, he had repeated the
evil deed committed by Justinian's empress Theodora, a
hundred and sixteen years before, and compelled the
Roman clergy under threat of worse things to elect a
new Pope while the Pope was living, though in this case
the elected was himself blameless and excellent. It is
true, also, that later still he had treated the great confessor
Maximus with equal cruelty. But these crimes did not
prevent his being the actual emperor to whom loyal
submission was due from the great throne of justice in
the earth. It would seem also by the mode in which
Constans had received the nuntios who bore Pope
Vitalian's synodical letter, announcing his accession, and
by the superb present which he sent back in acknowledgement,
that somehow a better spirit prevailed at the
moment towards the Pope. We are met indeed by the
fact that the Monothelite patriarch Peter held the see of
Constantinople for twelve years from the death of the
re-established Pyrrhus in 654, to his own death in 666,
being the fourth heretic in succession from Sergius in
the see of the royal city. Constans approached Rome
at the head of an army. He made his offerings as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
emperor to the three great churches of Rome, the
Lateran, St. Peter's and St. Mary Major. The Pope was
completely at his mercy. He lodged in the imperial
palace on the Palatine, which, however great its desolation,
was able at least to receive him. In his twelve
days sojourn he laid his hands upon every bronze
statue which he thought worth plundering: and he
stripped of its costly roof the church which his predecessor
sixty years before had given to the Pope, dedicated
to the Mother of God and all Martyrs.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such a visit accompanied by such acts give a lively
picture of the regard entertained by a Byzantine emperor
for the city which gave him his title. It sums up the
hundred and ten years of abject servitude into which all
Italy had fallen since the capture of the city by Narses
under Justinian. We have the contemptuous despot,
the long-suffering Pope, the half-ruined powerless city.
Three hundred and six years had passed since the degenerate
son of Constantine, when he came to Rome in
357, was amazed at the beauty of its great buildings,
the forum of Trajan, the theatre of Pompey, the unequalled
Flavian amphitheatre. But in Constans the
memories of Rome were dead: he robbed the last relic
of its grandeur, Agrippa's pantheon, nor was he ready
to reverence the protection of the Blessed Virgin over
the Church dedicated to her by the Pope on receiving it
as the gift of a preceding emperor. These last spoils he
had embarked for his royal city, but they were detained
at Syracuse, and on its capture shortly afterwards by
the Saracens fell into their hands.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But before this event the life and misdeeds of the
emperor Constans II. had come to a sudden end. He
was living in Ortygia, the sole remaining quarter of
that once princely city, wherein Achradyna, Tyche,
Neapolis, and Epipolæ lay desolate. He had entered
his bath one day, and received in it a blow on his head
by his attendant, whether a slave, or a conspirator. His
courtiers when they at length came in found him dead.
The Greek chronologist Theophanes alleges as a reason
for this event that after his murder of his brother he
became greatly hated at Constantinople, both for his
persecution of Pope Martin and Maximus, <span class="tei tei-q">“that most
wise confessor, whose tongue he cut out, and whose
hands he cut off, and condemned many of the orthodox
with tortures, banishments, and confiscations, because
they would not submit to his heresy”</span>. In his dread he
had wished to transfer his residence to the West, but
this his counsellors prevented. His treatment of the
Sicilians was so bad that some in despair went to settle
at Damascus, though it had become the capital of the
chalif.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So lived and so died the grandson of Heraclius,
Constans II., <span class="tei tei-q">“Roman emperor and Christian prince”</span><a id="noteref_117" name="noteref_117" href="#note_117"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">117</span></span></a>
from 642 to 668, in the times when the chalifs of
Mohammed, Omar, Osman, Ali, and Muawiah carved
the Saracen realm out of the empire which Heraclius
had possessed, and out of the kingdom of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Great
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
King,”</span> whom Heraclius, when bearing the standard of
the cross had brought low. If Heraclius treated Syria
and Egypt as Constans treated Rome and Italy, is not
the wonder diminished that in the ten years of Omar
the structure of Roman power which had lasted seven
centuries was overthrown, and those provinces had
received a Mohammedan instead of a Byzantine master?
Muawiah at Damascus cherished the Syria which at
Antioch the lord on the Bosphorus had ground down
with taxes. The Rome also which Constans, when he
had been welcomed as its emperor, left stripped of its
last ornaments was regarded with veneration by the
farthest isle of the West, which it was winning at once
to civilised and to Christian life. An English authority
tells us that five years after the visit of Constans, Pope
Vitalian, in the twelfth year of his pontificate, on the
26th March, 668, consecrated a monk of Tarsus, then
living at Rome, learned both in secular and divine
literature, speaking both Greek and Latin, of holy life,
and venerable in age, being sixty-six years old. Thus
Theodore was sent to be Archbishop of Canterbury. He
was received in his passage through France by the
Archbishop of Arles, and the bishop of Paris. He
reached his see in the following year, 669, and sat in it
full twenty-one years.<a id="noteref_118" name="noteref_118" href="#note_118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">118</span></span></a>
St. Bede's account of him says
that he went over the whole island, wheresoever there
were English, was received by all most cordially, and
obeyed, when he gave them a right order of life, and
the canonical celebration of Easter, which he spread
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
abroad. St. Bede adds that he was the first among the
archbishops whom the whole Church of the English consented
to obey. His friend Adrian, who had recommended
him to the Pope, and accompanied him from Rome,
attended him in England: they had a large number of
disciples, whom they instructed not only in theology,
but in music, astronomy, and arithmetic. St. Bede
wrote forty years after the death of Theodore, and says,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Even at this day there survive persons taught by them,
who know the Greek and Latin languages as well as
their own. Nor from the time the English came to
Britain were there ever happier times, since, possessing
kings most valiant and at the same time Christian, they
were a terror to all barbarous nations; and the vows of
all men tended to the joys of the heavenly kingdom but
newly revealed to them; and all who wished to be instructed
in the sacred lessons had masters ready to
teach them.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Constans was succeeded by his son Constantine IV.
after he had put down in Sicily a short-lived rebellion.
He did not imitate his father's violent deeds: he did
not wish to maintain by force the Typus, which was still
in legal existence. Pope Vitalian had done him service
in his struggle with the usurper, and made use of his
favourable sentiments to proceed with more decision
against the Monothelites.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Monothelite patriarch Peter had died in 666, two
years before Constans. The three following patriarchs,
Thomas II., John V., and Constantine, inclined to
orthodoxy. They occupied together only nine years,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from 667 to 676. The Sixth Council left their names in
the diptychs. Yet so great was the power which the
Monothelites possessed in the capital that Constantine
Pogonatus, though not a Monothelite, and much wishing
to be reconciled with the Roman Church, thought it
dangerous at the beginning of his government to alter
the state of things; and the Typus, as law imposed by
the State, was not abrogated. The next patriarch,
Theodore, in 670 was again Monothelite, and he was,
though moderate himself, induced by Makarius, patriarch
of Antioch, to erase from the diptychs the names of all
the Popes since Honorius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pope Vitalian, after an admirable pontificate of
fourteen years and a half, had died in 672, and was
succeeded by the Roman, Adeodatus, who sat four years,
and he by Pope Donus, also a Roman, in 676.
Donus died in 678, and was followed by Agatho, a
Sicilian of Palermo.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During seven years, which end in 678, the Emperor
Constantine was fighting a battle of life or death with
the Saracen chalif Muawiah for Constantinople itself.
Every year during several months the Saracen fleet was
in the waters of the Bosphorus. They had taken the
city of Cyzikus and wintered there, renewing the contest
in the spring. During seven years they continued to do
this. Had they taken the city the whole Christian
empire in the East would have fallen. It is hard to limit
the ruin which would have ensued to the Christian
Church. But in weighing the events of this century the
extreme peril in which the Church lay through the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
furious outburst of the Saracens should not be forgotten.
On this occasion the Greek fire is said to have been first
used. By it, as water would not extinguish it, many
ships and their crews were destroyed. After this conflict
of seven years, the Saracens having lost a great multitude
of men, at last retired, owning that they were
defeated. Their fleet in retiring met with a great
tempest, and in a battle also which took place with
three imperial commanders the Saracens lost 30,000 men.
Muawiah, the chalif, treated for peace with the emperor,
and it was concluded on glorious terms for the empire.
This victory led the northern Avars also to treat the
emperor with deference.<a id="noteref_119" name="noteref_119" href="#note_119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">119</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus the emperor was enabled to execute his wish for
the restoration of communion with the West. He
addressed a letter to Pope Donus on the 12th August,
678, requesting him to send commissioners to Constantinople
to make arrangements for a Council to be held
there. Pope Donus had died in 678 and this letter was
received by his successor, Agatho. He desired the whole
West on this occasion to be called to council, and for
that purpose caused particular synods to be held everywhere.
During this year Theodore, the patriarch of
Constantinople, was deposed, it is not known on what
grounds, but he was indisposed to union with the West.
In his stead George was chosen, who at first was on the
Monothelite side, but, instructed by the testimonies of
the Fathers and the synods at Rome, which were read in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Sixth Council, he attached himself strongly to the
orthodox.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pope Agatho, waiting for many bishops, among them
English, to come to Rome, only held in March, 680, his
synod of 125 bishops in preparation for the Council to be
held in Constantinople, and to name legates to attend it.
This was a great Council of the western patriarchate,
which had been preceded by smaller Councils in the
several provinces, as, for instance, Milan. Agatho and
the council sent two letters to the emperor, which
developed the creed of the Church according to the
Lateran Council of 649, and signified its acceptance as
necessary to all believers. The priests Theodore and
George, the deacon John, and the sub-deacon Constantine
were appointed legates for the Roman Church; the
Bishops Abundantius of Paterno, John of Porto, and
John of Reggio as deputies for the Council; and the
priest Theodore to represent Ravenna. Agatho described
these commissioners, not as learned theologians, for the
confusion of the times made such very rare. His words
run, <span class="tei tei-q">“How can perfect knowledge of the Scriptures be
found in men who live in the midst of heathens and get
their support by manual labour with the greatest difficulty?
but we maintain whatever has been defined by
our apostolic predecessors and the Five Councils in
simplicity of heart as the unambiguous faith descending
from our fathers”</span>.<a id="noteref_120" name="noteref_120" href="#note_120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">120</span></span></a>

Theodore, Archbishop of Canterbury, had been invited
by the Pope to attend his Council at Rome, but was unable
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to come. In the preceding year, 679, St. Wilfrid,
Bishop of York, was heard at the Lateran on his appeal
in a Council of 16 bishops and restored to his see.<a id="noteref_121" name="noteref_121" href="#note_121"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">121</span></span></a>

The legates were honourably received in the capital
and lodged in the Placidia Palace. After their arrival
on the 10th September, 680, the emperor invited the
patriarch George, of Constantinople, and through him
Makarius, of Antioch, to call to council the metropolitans
subject to them. At first the court had not thought of
the sees of Alexandria and Jerusalem, which were under
Saracen domination. But before the Council entered on
deliberation two regular priests, Peter and George, were
found, the first to represent Alexandria, the last to stand
in the place of Theodore, vicar of the patriarchate of
Jerusalem. It would seem that it was as well through
this representation of the other sees, as also because of
what Pope Agatho had done, that the Council which
now met, though it had not been the original purpose
of the emperor, from its beginning was marked as ecumenical,
and afterwards took rank as the Sixth of these
with the Five preceding.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Council was held from the 7th November, 680, to
the 16th September, 681, in the hall called the Dome of
the Imperial Palace, under the presidency of the papal
legates and the imperial presidency of honour. The
Emperor, with many officers of State, was present at the
first eleven sessions, and with them directed the external
order of business; but both he and they were carefully
distinguished from the members of the Council, whose
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
numbers did not at first reach a hundred, but afterwards
rose to 174.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the first session, the 7th September, the Roman
deputies, in an address to the emperor, desired that
those who represented the Byzantine Church would
declare the origin of the innovation which had existed in
it for more than forty years. Macarius and his associates
appealed to the earlier General Councils and to the
Fathers. Thereupon the acts of the Council of Ephesus
were read. There was found in them nothing in favour
of the Monothelites, for the words of Cyril, that the will
of Christ was almighty, could only be referred to His
divine nature. In the second session, on the 10th
November, the acts of the Council of Chalcedon were
read, which were entirely unfavourable to the heresy.
Macarius in vain attempted to insist on the words
<span class="tei tei-q">“theandric operation”</span> without determining their meaning.
On the reading the acts of the Fifth Council, at
the third sitting, the 13th November, the writing of
Mennas to Vigilius and two alleged letters of the latter
were admitted to be spurious. The Monothelites could
show nothing for themselves out of the General Councils.
They had now to seek proof from the writings of the
Fathers. They begged for time, and, on the proposition
of George of Constantinople, the letters of Agatho and
the Roman Council were ordered to be read, which
occupied the fourth session, on the 15th November.
In the fifth and sixth sessions, of the 7th December,
680, and the 12th February, 681, Macarius proposed
passages from the writings of Fathers in behalf of his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
doctrine, but it was shown that they were mostly
falsified or imperfectly quoted or indecisive. At the
seventh session, 13th February, 681, the Roman
collection of passages from the Fathers in support of the
doctrine of Two Wills and Two Operations was read
against the others. George and Macarius received copies
of them. While Macarius remained obstinate, George
was convinced of the correctness of the doctrine set forth
in the papal letters, and on the 17th February he gave
in a confession to the Roman legates in which the Two
Wills and the Two Operations were expressly acknowledged.
When, then, the emperor at the eighth session,
on the 7th March, questioned the bishops on their
accession to the letters of Agatho, not only George
of Constantinople admitted this, who requested and
obtained from the emperor the reinsertion of Pope
Vitalian into the diptychs of his Church, but also
Theodore of Ephesus, Sisinnius of Heraklea, Domitius of
Prusias, and other bishops, mostly in the jurisdiction of
Byzantium, five also from that of Antioch. On the
contrary, Macarius put in a confession directed against
<span class="tei tei-q">“the godless heresy”</span> of Maximus. The examination of
the patristic passages put in by him began, which was
continued in the following session of March 8, wherein
Macarius took no more part. He and his pupil Stephen
were deposed as falsifiers of the faith and teachers of
error. At the tenth session, the 18th March, the testimonies
put in by the Roman legates were, after collation
with the manuscripts of the patriarchal archives, found
correct, and a confession agreeing with the declaration of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Agatho was delivered by Theodore, Bishop of Melitene,
and others. As the close of the eleventh session, the 20th
March, in which at the instance of the representative
from Jerusalem, the letter of St. Sophronius to Sergius,
and, at the instance of the Roman legates, four passages
of Macarius and his pupil Stephen were read, the emperor
announced that as he was prevented from further attendance
at the sessions by state business, four officials of
rank would henceforth represent him. But, besides, the
chief matter was already settled. Old and New Rome
were again united in belief.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the twelfth sitting on the 22nd March a number
of writings were read which Macarius had transmitted
to the emperor, but the emperor sent on to the Council
unread. Among them were contained the letters of
Sergius to Cyrus and Honorius, and the answer of the
latter. These documents were collated with the manuscripts
of the patriarchal archive, and found to agree.
Thereupon in the thirteenth session, on the 28th March,
condemnation was passed upon the heads and favourers
of Monothelitism, on Theodore of Pharan, Cyrus of Alexandria,
Sergius, Pyrrhus, Paul, Peter of Constantinople
(the three patriarchs next following, of whom nothing
heretical was found, were spared), as likewise upon
<span class="tei tei-q">“Honorius of Rome, who followed Sergius and confirmed
his teaching”</span>. The synodal letter of Sophronius was
acknowledged as orthodox. In the fourteenth session,
on the 5th April, at which also the newly-elected
Catholic patriarch of Antioch, Theophanes, was present,
the falsifications in the Fifth Council, the writing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ascribed to Mennas and the two suppositious letters of
Vigilius, were laid under anathema. On the octave of
Easter, the 14th April, John, bishop of Porto, celebrated
Mass in the emperor's presence at Sancta Sophia according
to the Latin rite. The monk and priest Polychronius,
who already in the fourteenth session had been accused
by Domitius, bishop of Prusias, as a deceiver of the
people, was brought before the Council at its fifteenth
session on the 26th April. He desired in confirmation
of the Monothelite doctrine to raise up a dead man. He
was allowed to try in order to undeceive the people.
He laid his confession of faith upon a dead body which
was brought in, and whispered for two hours long into
his ears, of course without effect. As he was not shaken
in his attachment to the heresy, he was deprived of his
rank as priest, and excommunicated. In the sixteenth
session, which was held, after a long interval, on the 9th
August, a Syrian priest, Constantine of Apamea, wished
to get the doctrine recognised that there were in Christ
two operations belonging to the Natures, but only one
personal Will of the Word: that besides this Christ had
once indeed also a natural human Will, but that He laid
aside this at the crucifixion together with flesh and
blood. The Council condemned this doctrine as savouring
of Manichean and Apollinarian heresy, issued
anathema against those whom it condemned, and resolved
to publish a confession of faith, which was considered at
the seventeenth session of the 11th September, and
solemnly proclaimed at the closing session on the 16th
September, in presence of the emperor. In this, after
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
agreement declared with the five preceding General
Councils, it was proclaimed that there are to be received
in Christ Two Natural Operations and Two Natural Wills
undivided, inseparable, unchangeable, and unmixed,
which are not contrary to each other, since the human
will follows the divine and is subject to it, is indeed
deified and exalted, but not removed or extinguished.
Neither of the Two Natures can be without operation or
without will. The Council thanked the emperor in a
special address for his labours to bring about the peace
of the Church, requested that five accredited copies of
the decree of faith should be provided for the five
patriarchal sees, and in a special letter to the Pope besought
the confirmation of their decrees by him.<a id="noteref_122" name="noteref_122" href="#note_122"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">122</span></span></a>
Besides this very brief summary of the eighteen sessions
of the Sixth Council, it is requisite to take notice of
certain documents which were either presented to the
Council by the legates, as their commission from the
Pope, or proceeded from the Council or the emperor at
its conclusion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pope Agatho had committed to his legates a long
letter to the emperor. One passage from it may shew
how plainly he set forth the authority of the Apostolic
See and its inerrancy in matters of faith. He lays
down the doctrine which opposes the Monothelite
heresy, not as a matter for discussion, but as absolutely
determined. <span class="tei tei-q">“St. Peter,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“received the charge
to feed the spiritual sheep of the Church by a triple
commendation from the Redeemer of all Himself. By
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his help this apostolical Church of his never turned aside
from the way of truth to any error. The whole Catholic
Church and General Councils followed in all things his
authority as that of the chief of the apostles. This is
the true rule of faith, which in prosperity and adversity
the spiritual mother of your empire, the Apostolic Church
of Christ, has kept unswervingly, which, by the grace of
Almighty God, will be proved never to have erred from
the path of apostolic tradition. It has never yielded to
the corruption of heretical novelties, but as from the
beginning of the Christian faith it has received from its
authors the chief apostles, it has continued spotless
according to the divine promise of the Lord our Saviour
Himself, which He spoke to the chief of His disciples in
the gospel: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Peter, behold Satan has sought to sift you,
but I have prayed for thee,’</span> etc. Let your clemency
consider how the Lord and Saviour of all, whose the
faith is, who promised that the faith of Peter should not
fail, charged him to confirm his brethren, which it is
known to all that the apostolic pontiffs, my predecessors,
have ever confidently done.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A more peremptory assertion cannot be made than
this, and it is made by a Pope to an emperor, on the
occasion of calling a General Council. It is carried by
his legates, as ambassadors carry the commission of their
sovereign. The answer<a id="noteref_123" name="noteref_123" href="#note_123"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">123</span></span></a> which the Council sent at its
conclusion to the Pope shows how it was received.
It ascribes to the Pope in fullest terms the position
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which he claimed, beginning in these words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Greatest
diseases require the greatest remedies, as you, most
Blessed, know; and therefore Christ our God, whose
power created, whose wisdom provides all things, has
appointed your Holiness as a skilled physician to meet
the contagion of heresy by the force of true belief, and
to impart the vigour of health to the members of the
Church. We then, having read through the letters of
a true confession sent by your paternal Blessedness to the
most gracious emperor, leave to you what is to be done;
to you who hold the first see of the universal Church,
standing on the firm rock of faith. We recognise your
letters as written from the supreme head of the apostles.
By them we have cast out the heretical sect which has
lately set up its manifold error. According to the
sentence previously passed upon them, we have cast
out Theodore, bishop of Pharan, Sergius, Honorius,
Cyrus, Paul, Pyrrhus, and Peter. We have sent what
we have done, and these things will be learned from those
who represented you, Theodore and George, priests; John,
deacon; and Constantine, sub-deacon. They state accurately
the doctrine which they have approved, which
we beseech your paternal Holiness to set your seal upon
by your honoured rescript.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Is it possible to accept in more express terms the
authority claimed by the Pope in his letter to the
emperor, including that descent from Peter, to whom
the promise made by our Lord is made the source and
the guarantee of the authority? Is it possible more
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fully to acknowledge his right to confirm, in their own
words, <span class="tei tei-q">“to set his seal”</span> on their proceedings?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the Council also congratulated the emperor on
the work over which as sovereign he had presided. Its
success they attribute to the Pope in these words:
<span class="tei tei-q">“The highest of all,<a id="noteref_124" name="noteref_124" href="#note_124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">124</span></span></a> the first apostle fought with us;
for we had for our supporter, who by his writing set
forth the mystery of theology, his imitator and the
successor of his chair. The city of Rome the elder
presented to you a confession dictated by God, and
caused the daylight of belief to rise from the West.
Paper and ink it seemed, but Peter spoke by Agatho.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This address is signed first by the three legates,
Theodore, George and John, <span class="tei tei-q">“holding the place of most
Blessed Agatho, universal Pope of the City of Rome,”</span>
next by <span class="tei tei-q">“George, by the mercy of God bishop of Constantinople,
New Rome”</span>—thirdly by Peter, a priest,
holding the place of the Apostolic See of Alexandria;
fourthly by Theophanes,<a id="noteref_125" name="noteref_125" href="#note_125"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">125</span></span></a> by the mercy of God bishop
of Antioch, Theopolis; fifthly by George, the priest,
representing Theodore, not bishop but representing the
See of Jerusalem.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus these two patriarchates could only shew two
priests to record their agreement.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The emperor issued an edict<a id="noteref_126" name="noteref_126" href="#note_126"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">126</span></span></a> in which he set forth a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
most carefully drawn creed. He also addressed a letter<a id="noteref_127" name="noteref_127" href="#note_127"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">127</span></span></a> to Pope Leo, who had succeeded Agatho. He mentions
how the legates of the Pope had been received, how every
authority of Scripture and the preceding Councils had
been carefully examined; <span class="tei tei-q">“moreover we beheld as it
were with the eyes of our mind the chief of the apostolic
choir, the Peter of the first see, setting forth the mystery
of the whole dispensation, and addressing us in the
words of Christ: Thou art Christ the Son of the living
God. For his sacred letter portrayed to us the whole
Christ, which we joyfully and sincerely received and
folded him in our arms as Peter himself. God has done
glorious things and preserved to us the faith entire.
How should He not in that rock in which He founded
the Church Himself, and foretold that the gates of hell,
the snares of heretics, should not prevail against it?
Act therefore as a man and be firm, gird thyself with
the sword of the word, and sharpen it with divine zeal.
Be the firm champion of the right faith; study to cut
short every heretical talk or attempt as of old Peter
struck off with the sword the sense of Jewish hearing,
prefiguring the deafness of the legal and servile synagogue.
The condition of the whole Roman polity is
tranquillised with the tranquillity of the faith. We
exhort therefore your most sacred headship<a id="noteref_128" name="noteref_128" href="#note_128"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">128</span></span></a> to send at
once your nuntio to our royal city, that he may dwell
here and in all emergent matters, dogmatic, canonical,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or simply ecclesiastical may express the person of your
Holiness.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Farewell in the Lord, most blessed, and pray the
more earnestly for our realm.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have, therefore, on this great occasion a complete
concurrence of three authorities; of the Pope in addressing
an eastern emperor in prospect of a General Council,
of that Council itself answering this address of the Pope;
of the emperor in his letter to the Pope by his legates
returning to him from the Council; and it is to be noted
that the Pope does not assert the nature of his authority
as descending by a divine grant to Peter and exercised
in virtue of it during six centuries with any greater
emphasis than the emperor and the Council acknowledge
it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the meantime Pope Agatho had died on the 10th
January, 681. The see remained vacant eighteen months,
during which the Council ended. Leo II. was consecrated
the 17th August, 682, and his short pontificate ended
the 3rd July, 683. To him the letter of the emperor
was carried, and he discharged the office of confirming
this Council, as St. Leo had confirmed that of Chalcedon,
and of bringing it to the knowledge of the West.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The letter to the emperor, in which Leo II. confirms
the Sixth Council, is a document extending over nearly
six folio columns.<a id="noteref_129" name="noteref_129" href="#note_129"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">129</span></span></a> It shows throughout the Pope's
great anxiety for the exact maintenance of the faith, and
how severe had been the struggle with the heresy which
had been upheld by two emperors and by four successive
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
patriarchs of the imperial city. The Pope draws out in
it a creed of the utmost minuteness in regard of the contested
doctrine, the Person of our Lord in His Two
Natures. He repeats his acknowledgment of the Five
preceding General Councils as handing down one continuous
doctrine from the beginning, and joins with them
the Council just held as witness of the same doctrine;
and he likewise joins the heretics during several hundred
years from Arius, in one anathema, which closes with
the inventors of this new error—that is, <span class="tei tei-q">“Theodore,
Bishop of Pharan, Cyrus of Alexandria, Sergius, Pyrrhus,
Paul, and Peter, who lurked like thieves in the See of
Constantinople rather than sat as guides;<a id="noteref_130" name="noteref_130" href="#note_130"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">130</span></span></a> nay, and also
Honorius, who did not set himself to hallow this
Apostolic Church by the teaching of the apostolic
tradition, but allowed it, being spotless, to be stained by
a profane betrayal”</span>. These words, by which St. Leo
expressed how far he assented to the condemnation of
Honorius by the Council, have a light thrown upon them
by the words which he used in making known the condemnation
of the Monothelites to the Spanish bishops,
when among the condemned he included Honorius, <span class="tei tei-q">“who
did not extinguish the flame of heretical doctrine when
it first arose, as was the office of the apostolic authority,
but by neglecting fostered it”</span>.<a id="noteref_131" name="noteref_131" href="#note_131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">131</span></span></a> And, again, in announcing
the confirmation of the Council to the Spanish king,
Erwig, he says of Honorius, <span class="tei tei-q">“who allowed the spotless
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a name="Pg252" id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rule of the apostolic tradition, which he had received
from his predecessors, to be stained”</span>.<a id="noteref_132" name="noteref_132" href="#note_132"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">132</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be noted that St. Leo II. does not enter
into the matter contained in the letters of Honorius;
does not express agreement with words which passed in
the Council that <span class="tei tei-q">“they were opposed to apostolic belief,
to the declarations of Councils, and of all the approved
fathers,”</span> that <span class="tei tei-q">“they agreed with the false doctrines of
heretics”</span>; he does not repeat the reproach that Honorius,
by proof of his letter to Sergius, agreed in all respects
with his meaning, and confirmed his godless doctrines.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Be it sufficient for us to know that if the name of
Pope Honorius appeared in those sentences it certainly
was not because he really taught or held the Monothelite
heresy, but solely because with too great allowance he
did not rebuke it, nor set himself to strangle it at its
beginning, insomuch as undoubtedly that manner of
action had given great encouragement to the favourers
of those errors.”</span><a id="noteref_133" name="noteref_133" href="#note_133"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">133</span></span></a>
I quote two further judgments of the
present day, that <span class="tei tei-q">“the letters of Honorius contain
nothing heretical,”</span> and that <span class="tei tei-q">“in fact no error of faith
whatever is found in those letters of Honorius”</span>.<a id="noteref_134" name="noteref_134" href="#note_134"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">134</span></span></a> The
anathema which lies on the memory of Honorius, who
lived in renown and was buried in honour in St. Peter's,
is a warning given by the Holy See itself to everyone
who sits in that chair to weigh well both words and
conduct, and guard both from the slightest negligence
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span><a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in matters of doctrine. Honorius died before the Exposition
of Sergius was published or presented for his
acceptance. Had he lived to judge of it those who study
the history of the time succeeding down to the Sixth
Council cannot doubt that he would have censured it as
his successors censured it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Sixth Council closes a crisis of danger to the faith
of the Church than which no greater is to be found in all
history. The years from 638, in which Honorius died,
to 682, in which his successor St. Leo II. approved the
doctrinal decision of the Council, and further, allowed
the conduct of a predecessor to be condemned, are occupied
by ten successors of Honorius, every one of whom
with the utmost zeal condemned the heresy which was
supported by two emperors, wielding absolute power,
and by four successive patriarchs of Constantinople,
besides patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch. All these
put ecclesiastical authority at the service of these
emperors to carry out their will. Heraclius and
Constans II. were not theologians, and it required theological
skill to construct concerning the Person of our
Lord a heresy which could present itself to the fastidious
Greek mind, clothed in proper expressions of a language
lending itself with unsurpassable accuracy to every
variation of thought. Cyrus, made for his first suggestions,
by the grateful monarch, patriarch of Alexandria,
was so good as to provide Heraclius with doctrinal
decrees intended to make the disloyal sects of Egypt
believe that they could express their own false doctrine
in words which might pass for an assent to the Council
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Chalcedon and the doctrine of St. Leo. When the
patriarch Sophronius denounced the error and appealed
to Rome and Pope Honorius in words which after twelve
hundred years sound like a trumpet's call, Sergius being
patriarch of Constantinople, the bosom friend and most
trusted counsellor of Heraclius, holding the see of the
Golden City for eight and twenty years, living and
dying, too, in the greatest renown as an orthodox bishop,
approached Pope Honorius with insidious language,
totally disguising the real state of things in the East.
He wished the Pope to believe that Cyrus of Alexandria
was winning the proud and tumultuous sects of Egypt
to Catholic union with the doctrine of St. Leo, which
Honorius held with the utmost fidelity. Not only did
he write letters, but he constructed a document to which
he induced the emperor to set the imperial seal and
require it to be signed by all bishops, and especially by
the bishop of Rome. The document was intended to
introduce that heresy formulated by Cyrus, which
Sophronius exposed and refuted. Pope Honorius died
in October 638, and never saw this document. Sergius
got it passed by his Council at Constantinople, but died
himself in December of the same year. Pope Severinus
was elected to succeed Honorius before the end of the
year 638, but his consecration was delayed by Greek
intrigues for nineteen months, in the hope of obtaining
his assent to the document drawn up by Sergius. This
was found to be hopeless. The exarch then contented
himself with plundering the Lateran treasury. Pope
Severinus was at length consecrated, and sat for two
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
months and six days, in which time however he condemned
the Ecthesis. He was succeeded by two Popes,
John IV. and Theodore, who behaved with the same
decision and fortitude. But a new emperor had succeeded,
after a frightful revolution, at twelve years of
age; and a new patriarch of Constantinople was ready
to draw up a new document for the heresy. It was met
by another Pope, whose first act was to call a great
Council at the Lateran, to condemn the heresy under
anathema, and the two documents, of which the first
was fathered by Heraclius, and the second by Constans
II. For this act of courage St. Martin four years afterwards
was stolen from Rome, judged at Constantinople
as a traitor by the senate, and sent a prisoner to die of
famine, as is believed, in the Crimea. The emperor,
having Rome in full possession, used such means that
Eugenius was put into the see while St. Martin was still
living as a condemned criminal. But Eugenius could
not be compelled to accept the heresy of the Byzantine
monarch and patriarch. There follow five Popes, Vitalian,
Adeodatus, Donus, Agatho, and Leo II. At
length, when Constans had perished miserably in his
bath at Syracuse, his son Constantine broke the line of
heretical emperors. But he found in truth the heresy
so embedded in his capital that he was obliged to act
with great caution. After repulsing a Mohammedan
attack upon his capital which lasted seven years, and
was overcome only by the aid of the Greek fire, when if
the city had been taken the Greek empire would have
ended, and the patriarch of Constantinople have shared
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the lot of his brethren at Alexandria and Antioch, the
emperor was enabled to invite Pope Donus to hold a
Council at Constantinople which should terminate this
long struggle. It was a struggle in which the whole
West followed the Pope, but much of the East was in
favour of the heresy. Pope Agatho had succeeded
Donus; he accepted the request of the emperor, he had
Councils held through the West, and a full patriarchal
Council at Rome. So he appeared by his legates at Constantinople,
and was welcomed with the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“Peter
has spoken by Agatho,”</span> as 230 years before they cried,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Peter has spoken by Leo”</span>. But Agatho also died before
the Council had finished its work, and the tenth successor
of Honorius, Leo II., during his short pontificate
of ten months, set his seal upon the Council, and endured
to censure a predecessor for neglect of his office, and for
allowing by that neglect a heresy to obtain a temporary
success. Ten Popes in succession, one of them actually
martyred, all of them vassals of absolute sovereigns, had
during all this interval of forty years alone prevented
the heresy being forced upon the Church. Four
patriarchs of Constantinople in succession had fostered
it; and four were together condemned. They were
condemned, not for negligence in allowing others to
spread the heresy, but as its originators; as advisers
and mouthpiece of emperors, all whose power had been
bent by them to extort approval of it from Popes, who
in their civil position were helpless subjects in a <span class="tei tei-q">“servile”</span>
province, but in their religious character were
successors of St. Peter.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now at the time the western emperor ceased to
exist seven Popes succeeding St. Leo defended his
doctrine against two emperors, Zeno and Anastasius,
and foiled all the efforts of Acacius to use the eastern
jealousy and the pride of the royal city, and exalt his see
above the control of St. Peter's successor, until the
seventh Pope, Hormisdas, then a subject of the Arian
Gothic king, Theodorich, compelled the eastern emperor,
the patriarch, the bishops, and the court, to confess his
supreme authority, as successor of St. Peter. Seven
Popes then stood neither hesitating nor fluctuating: over
against them in that time stood seven bishops of Constantinople,
one originator of the whole schism, others
yielding to the emperor's will even against their own
wishes. It was a contest of 44 years with an oriental
despotism, waged by Popes the subjects of Arian Goths.
They alone maintained the faith of the Church, as embodied
in the decrees of the Council of Chalcedon, and
saved the East.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, again, there has been a struggle for 44 years, in
which ten Popes, subjects of the eastern emperor, and
liable as such to be summoned by him to his capital,
where one of them was indeed condemned to death,
stood likewise as one man. They dwelt in a Rome no
longer recognised as the head of the empire. Of this
whole seventh century the special historian of the city
says that for Rome it was <span class="tei tei-q">“the most frightful, the most
devastating of all”</span>.<a id="noteref_135" name="noteref_135" href="#note_135"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">135</span></span></a> Civil power was not in their hands.
Their election itself had to be confirmed by the exarch
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as representing the emperor, or by the emperor himself.
The first of the ten, Pope Severinus, had to wait nineteen
months for it, after which he sat two months. The last
of the ten, St. Leo II., began to sit eighteen months
after the death of his predecessor, St. Agatho, and then
only sat ten months. During the whole of this period,
from the death of Honorius in 638, to the ratification of
the Sixth Council in 682, the yielding of any one of these
ten Popes would have carried with it the subjection of
the whole church to the Monothelite error. They saved
the East, they saved the Royal City, the seat of all power,
in spite of its four patriarchs condemned as heretics.
That Heraclius and Constans did not destroy the faith
in the seventh century is as much their work and merit
as that Zeno and Anastasius did not destroy it in the
fifth. Perhaps the test which by the force of circumstances
was applied to the Popes from the time Rome
was governed from Constantinople as a captive city in
the second half of the sixth and the whole of the seventh
century was even more severe than that applied to them
in the fifth. Their condition was more helpless, inasmuch
as the Byzantine subjection was heavier than the Arian
Gothic control, while the pillaged Italy of the exarchs
was wretched, and the prosperous realm of Theodoric
guarded jealously the last remains of imperial grandeur.
He at least was a king in Italian Ravenna and Verona,
and Rome was both great and dear to him. But
Justinian and those who followed him were task-masters
on the Bosphorus, who placed a tax-collector at Ravenna
to wring out the last drop of Italy's blood, and plunder,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as occasion served, the treasury of the Church in the
Pope's Lateran Patriarcheion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In what consisted the power by which twenty-nine
Popes from Pelagius I. in 555, to Gregory II. in 715
bore so fearful a strain? Solely in one thing: in the
belief that the throne of St. Peter had been fixed at
Rome, and that St. Peter had received by a direct gift
from Christ, and his successor had inherited, the charge
to feed and govern the universal Church. The five
times captured Rome lived on in this belief, and was
become the city of the Popes. The eye of a conqueror,
legislator and ruler, had chosen with a wisdom which all
posterity has acknowledged the fairest and the strongest
of cities for the seat of his power. He made it a royal
residence; he could not make it an apostolic see. When
at length his city fell, the empire fell with it. In the
day of its pride it sought to trample on the elder Rome by
the privileges of new Rome. The second of these attempts
was foiled by the ten successors of Pope Honorius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The danger to the Christian faith in these fifty years
which begin, it is to be noted, at the death of Mohammed
and the election of a chalif in his stead, has been touched
upon; but the danger to the empire must not be dissociated
from it. All the tyranny, the extortion, the
spiritual encroachment of the empire could not sever
the links which bound it to the Church. Heraclius had
been warned by his former minister Maximus how
perilous to his empire his meddling with the creed would
be.<a id="noteref_136" name="noteref_136" href="#note_136"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">136</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is not a time for such things,”</span> he said. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
time of blood on account of our sins, not of theologising;
a time of lamentation, a time of imploring God's mercy,
not of sophistical contradiction, moving Him to greater
indignation.”</span> The Greek<a id="noteref_137" name="noteref_137" href="#note_137"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">137</span></span></a> chronographer in the ninth
century marks the rise of the Arabian enemy as a scourge
of Christian sins. He traces the whole calamitous series
of events to the seduction of Heraclius, by a certain
Athanasius, full of native Syrian guile, whom he
promised to make and did afterwards make patriarch of
Antioch: Heraclius was confused by his use of new
terms. He consulted Sergius, and also Cyrus, then
bishop of Phasis. He found the three agree. He
followed them. He translated Cyrus from Phasis to
Alexandria. Then Heraclius issued an imperial edict
on doctrine. When Constans had succeeded as emperor
another imperial edict on doctrine, drawn up by another
bishop of Constantinople, appeared, which St. Martin
condemned in his Council at Rome. Then the emperor
Constans, full of wrath, carried St. Martin and St.
Maximus to Constantinople, tortured them and banished
them to the Chersonese, and punished many of the
western bishops besides. But Agatho, being elected
Pope, and moved by the zeal of God, also summoned
a holy Council and put under ban the Monothelite
heresy. Upon all his narrative the conclusion of Theophanes
is: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Church being thrown into disorder by
emperors and impious bishops, Amalek the child of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
desert rose up to scourge us, the people of Christ. The
Roman army met with a great defeat on the Yarmuk.
There followed the capture of Palestine, of Cæsarea, of
Jerusalem, then the loss of Egypt, then the captivity of
inland and islands, and all Romania; the utter destruction
of the Roman force in Phœnicia, the dissolution of
all Christian peoples and places, which did not cease till
the persecutor of the Church perished miserably in his
bath in Sicily.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus when the Sixth Council met at Constantinople
not only had the emperor Constantine the Bearded
declined far from the position held by Justinian, at the
time in which he made Rome a garrison city in a servile
province, a hundred and thirty years before, but his
empire was not half so great as that of his great grandfather
Heraclius, after the triumph of the Persian war.
Not only were Syria and Egypt, and all Roman land
on the side of Persia, and northern Africa as far as
Kairowan, lost to the empire, but it had just escaped
utter destruction by repelling the fleet of Muawiah after
a conflict of several years from the waters of the Bosphorus.
And the great and abiding difference to the
eastern monarch was that he had lost this vast amount
of territory to an enemy who had put the propagation
of a different creed, antagonistic in its first principles to
the Christian faith, into the hands of a single man.
That single man, a chalif, wielding an absolute civil
power, appertinent to the prophet's spiritual authority,
had fixed the seat of his dominion in the heart of Rome's
former domain in the East. The Mohammedan now
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg 262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
moved upon Constantinople from his basis at Damascus.
He had advanced upon Sicily likewise, and had taken
Syracuse in 669, and from that time forth southern Italy
had to dread his descent upon its coasts. By his union
of spiritual and civil power in his person as chalif, he had
now the whole Saracen force by land and sea at his
command.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What were the Avars of the North or the Persians of
the East compared to this new enemy, whose war-cry
was, <span class="tei tei-q">“There is no God but God, and Mohammed is His
prophet”</span>; whose meaning was, <span class="tei tei-q">“There is no Christ, and
no Mother of God, and no saints and no sacrifice, no
kingdom in heaven to be gained by penance and humility.
But there is the reign of a prophet on earth; receive his
successor and you shall be our equals, refuse him and you,
your wives and your children will be the captives of his
sword.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These were the wounds struck by the Monothelite
heresy on the Christian Church and the eastern empire
in the first fifty years which ran from the death of
Mohammed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Constantine IV. died in 685, leaving the throne to his
son Justinian II. He had reigned since the murder of
his father in 668, and the whole course of his reign
showed a very favourable contrast with that of Constans
II. But greater still, if possible, was to be the contrast
presented to his government by that of his son, who
succeeded at a most immature age, and showed himself
without counsel, self-command, and reason in all that he
did. He was the first of several bad and incapable
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rulers. His tyranny deprived him of the throne after
ten years. He was deposed with the Byzantine penalty
of an amputated nose. Upon this deposition, in 695, the
following twenty-two years produced seven revolutions,
putting the imperial power into new hands and new
families. One of these violent changes replaced
Justinian II., maimed and dishonoured as he was, after
a banishment of ten years. But he had learned no
prudence, and the inhumanity of his last six years in his
second reign exceeded that of his first reign.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In those first ten years from 685 to 695 events
happened of importance to the Church, which also
illustrate the spirit dominant at Constantinople. The
condition of the empire required the strictest union with
the West. It was pressed severely by the Mohammedan
advance. To meet this effectually the reconciliation
which had taken place at the Sixth Council was needed to
be wisely and temporately maintained. But Justinian
II. summoned a Greek Council to meet in the same hall
of his palace, called the Dome, in which that Council
had been held. It passed a number of canons on
discipline, many of which were injurious to the West and
only calculated to increase the mutual estrangement.
Inasmuch as the Fifth and Sixth General Councils had
passed no canons of discipline, this Council held in 692
was to complete that omission. It called itself the
Quinisext. The later Greeks even confounded it with
the Sixth Council, others contented themselves with
saying that <span class="tei tei-q">“it was held five or six years after it, and by
nearly the same Fathers”</span>. It issued a hundred and two
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
canons on discipline. <span class="tei tei-q">“It seemed as if the bishops of
this Council in their disgust at the undeniable superiority
of the Roman Church in matters of faith, in which its
authority had always at last prevailed and determined
the issue, were bent on making good their right of
autonomy at least in matters of discipline, and sought
to avenge themselves by disapproving Roman customs
for that superiority burdensome to Greek vanity.”</span><a id="noteref_138" name="noteref_138" href="#note_138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">138</span></span></a> As a
matter of fact these canons had the effect of widening
the breach between Latins and Greeks. It is true that
in the eighth century all Greeks did not yet count them
ecumenical, but in the Iconoclast contest they gained
great consideration, and in the ninth century scarcely
a Byzantine doubted any longer that they were
ecumenical.<a id="noteref_139" name="noteref_139" href="#note_139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">139</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The chief value of this Council now lies in the picture
which it presents to us of the actual state and temper of
the eastern Church at that time, the closing ten years
of a century about which we possess so little detailed
information. I am here concerned especially with two
things—one, the position of the emperor as regards both
the Pope and the Church; the other, the position of the
patriarch of Constantinople; on both this Council casts
light.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As to the emperor, not only was it convoked<a id="noteref_140" name="noteref_140" href="#note_140"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">140</span></span></a> by his
command and assembled in a hall of his palace, but its
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
canons were subscribed by the emperor first with the
imperial vermilion, and the second place was left vacant
for the Pope's signature.<a id="noteref_141" name="noteref_141" href="#note_141"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">141</span></span></a>
Then followed the subscriptions
of Paul of Constantinople, Peter of Alexandria,
Anastasius of Jerusalem, George of Antioch; on the
whole, of 211 bishops, or their representatives, all Greeks
and Orientals, including Armenians. It styled itself
ecumenical, and the emperor tried to impose it as such.
In its address to the emperor it said by that it was
called<a id="noteref_142" name="noteref_142" href="#note_142"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">142</span></span></a>
by him <span class="tei tei-q">“to restore to order the Christian life,
and root out the remains of Jewish and heathen perversity,”</span>
while it ended by addressing to him the words,
<span class="tei tei-q">“as thou hast honoured the Church by convoking us, so
also be pleased to confirm what we have decreed”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As to the Bishop of Constantinople, this Council said
in its 36th canon, <span class="tei tei-q">“renewing the decrees of the Second
and Fourth General Councils, we decree that the see of
Constantinople enjoy the same prerogatives as that
of old Rome, and in ecclesiastical matters be as great as
it, counting as the second after it. After it comes the
see of Alexandria, then that of Antioch, then that of
Jerusalem.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In order to comprehend what this canon gave to the
see of Constantinople, it is requisite to bear in mind the
actual condition of the eastern Church at the time. We
are now at the year 692, that is full fifty years since
the other eastern patriarchates fell under Saracen
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
dominion.<a id="noteref_143" name="noteref_143" href="#note_143"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">143</span></span></a>
They had become more and more powerless. They
depended upon the alms and the support given to them
from Constantinople. In fact at this time the archbishop
of the Grecian capital was the only real patriarch
in the diminished empire. The courtiers of Constantinople,
as we have seen thirty years before in the persecution
of St. Maximus, affected to consider the conquests
of the Saracen barbarians as transitory. Since then
Constantinople itself had only been saved by hurling the
Greek fire on the assailing Saracen fleet. A shadow
only of their old right remained in the Saracen provinces
of Alexandria and Antioch; they had still their old
names. These were put down for them, if, as is supposed,
they were not present at this council, because there were
none at the moment. Four years later Carthage was
taken by the Saracens; within eight years the whole
Roman domination in Africa to the Atlantic was at an
end. The empire had not yet lost everything in the
West, for there were still some Byzantine troops and
possessions in Italy. The Pope still acknowledged the
emperor as his sovereign; and to Pope Sergius the
emperor Justinian II. sent these canons, with the request
that he would sign them. It is obvious that the
position given in them to the bishop of Constantinople
was no longer mere rank as in the first step taken in this
direction by the Council of 381 under the great Theodosius.
It was a higher jurisdiction similar in the East
to that which the Pope held in the West. The Byzantine
conception, as shewn in this Council, is clearly that the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
emperor was head of the Church, who, as he did it the
honour to call it together, so he did it the further honour
to confirm its decrees. Not, as in the case of the first
Constantine, that he should make them laws of the
empire, over and above their intrinsic spiritual force,
as canons of those to whom Christ had committed the
government of His Church, but that the emperor's
signature, in the same way as he created a law in civil
matters, made a canon in spiritual.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So ten years after the emperor Constantine IV. in the
Sixth Council and the Council itself asked from the Pope
for the confirmation of its decrees, his son Justinian II.
required the Pope as his subject to accept as one of five
patriarchs, three of whom it may be said were nonentities,
a position of subjection to himself in the spiritual
domain. The place left for the Pope's signature <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">after</span></em>
that of the emperor and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">before</span></em> that of the bishop of
Constantinople graphically represents the idea which
Justinian II. was seeking to impose. The Pope was to
sign as patriarch and first of the five, not as the successor
of St. Peter, who in virtue of his Primacy <span class="tei tei-q">“set his seal,”</span>
according to the expression of the Sixth Council, on the
whole. In the Trullan canons, the Byzantine idea
having evolved itself with undeviating encroachment
during three centuries, appears complete. Its completeness
is shewn in two things. Constantine IV. asked the
Pope to confirm the Council; his son Justinian confirms
it himself, and the council which he would confirm
exhibits an eastern primacy seated at Constantinople.
It admits not only the priority, but in a certain sense
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the superiority of the Roman primacy; but it would
keep both the eastern and the western primacy under
the imperial control. The eastern primacy would make
itself the chief instrument of this control, and so
practically put itself above the western.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As has been seen above, the emperors through four
patriarchs of their capital tried during forty years to
force the Monothelite heresy on the Popes. In like
manner from the Trullan Council they tried to force the
Greek discipline and the eastern primate upon the Popes.
Had they succeeded the ambition of the Byzantine
prelates would have reached its full success.<a id="noteref_144" name="noteref_144" href="#note_144"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">144</span></span></a> The
imperial residence on the Bosphorus would have taken
the place of old Rome. The city of Constantine, fighting
for very existence with the ever-advancing Mohammedan,
tried this last stroke in its hour of greatest
weakness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Turning to Rome at this time we find a very rapid
succession of Popes, for which we have no information
enabling us to account. They are also frequently Greeks
or Orientals; and here the suspicion arises that the exarch
of the emperor had influenced the election in the hope
that some national feeling might affect them in the
administration of their office. St. Agatho, who died in
January, 681, was a Sicilian of Palermo, St. Leo II., who
succeeded in 682 and died 683, was likewise a Sicilian.
The next, Benedict II., a Roman, sat only from June,
684, to May, 685; his successor, John V., a Syrian, of
Antioch, only from July, 685, to August, 686, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Conon, a Thracian, from October, 686, to September,
687. The following election was remarkable. There
were two parties among the electors<a id="noteref_145" name="noteref_145" href="#note_145"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">145</span></span></a>—one for the archpriest
Theodore, the other for the archdeacon Paschalis.
Both were in the Lateran palace. Here both sides
agreed to elect the priest Sergius. One of the rival
candidates, Theodore, did him homage at once; the
other, Paschalis, very unwillingly, and he secretly called
in the exarch from Ravenna to his aid. The exarch,
John Platina, came suddenly to Rome. He convinced
himself that the choice of Sergius was canonical and that
of the large majority, but as Paschalis had promised him
a donation of a hundred pounds' weight of gold, he
insisted upon being paid this sum from the Church's
treasury. Sergius was obliged to submit, and thereupon
was consecrated in December, 687, and sat till 701.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pope Sergius was born at Palermo, of Syrian parentage,
his father having settled there from Antioch. He
had come to Rome in the time of Pope Adeodatus, had
recommended himself by his ability, and had passed
through the various ranks of the clergy. His eastern
parentage did not prevent his offering as strenuous an
opposition to the heretical suggestions of the Greek
emperor as his predecessors had shewn.<a id="noteref_146" name="noteref_146" href="#note_146"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">146</span></span></a> One and the
same spirit lived in all the Popes: the will and the
genius of government. The natural quality of the old
Romans had been transfigured by the supernatural gift
belonging to the Church. The restless spirit of Byzantium,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
inexhaustible in the production of new theological
doctrines, which at least maintained a continuous interest
on the popular mind, tried in vain all the arms of Greek
sophistry and dialectic skill against the rock of Peter.
They recoiled from the sturdy Roman understanding
and only helped the Popes in their work of massing the
western fabric of concentrated discipline.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The rank of Rome<a id="noteref_147" name="noteref_147" href="#note_147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">147</span></span></a> as the holy city, reverence for the
head of the universal Church, veneration of the apostle
Peter, had mounted higher and higher at this time in
the West. If St. Peter had already enjoyed, at the
period of the Gothic denomination, a worship which impressed
the Greeks, his influence now had become more
decided, characteristic, and world-wide. It dwelt not so
much on his martyrdom, on his high rank as an apostle,
but rather on his being the founder of the Roman
Church and its see. The invisible saint in heaven was
the possessor in title of many domains and patrimonies
on earth: the theocratic king of Rome. He had begun
to consider its people as his own, he counted upon its
political government, which he transmitted like a celestial
fief to the Popes his successors. His golden tomb
at Rome in a Basilica radiant with gold had gradually
become the symbol of the Church and of the salvation
which the world received from this his institution.
Pilgrims from the furthest lauds now streamed to venerate
it. The Anglo-Saxons especially, in the glow of
their first conversion, were impelled by a passionate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
yearning to Rome. At the moment that the East sent
its pilgrims to Mecca and Medina, swarms of pious
pilgrims from Gaul, Spain, and Britain descended the
Alps to cast their eyes upon eternal Rome and prostrate
themselves before St. Peter's tomb, which had become
the sanctuary of the West.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the year 689 the young king of Wessex, Cadwalla,
excited the greatest admiration. After many battles at
home, he sheathed his sword and undertook the long
journey to Rome to receive baptism from Pope Sergius
himself. There on Easter eve the long-haired barbarian
king was seen in the white dress of the illuminated at
the porphyry baptismal font of the Lateran, with the
wax candle in his hand, and received the name of Peter.
He lived but eight days after, and was buried in the
atrium of St. Peter's, with a long inscription, still extant.
It said how King Cadwalla, for the love of God, left his
throne, his family, his country, all that the valour of
his ancestors and his own had gained him, coming far
over land and sea as a royal guest to behold Peter, and
Peter's see. He died at thirty years of age, in the reign
of the Lord Justinian, in the second year of the pontificate
of the apostolic man, Pope Sergius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Cadwalla's appearance at Rome was a prelude to those
long centuries wherein the Teutonic West would bow
before the spiritual authority of the Pope. Twenty years
later two other Anglo-Saxon kings, Conrad of Mercia,
and Offa of Essex, came to Rome, not to be baptised, for
they were already Christians, but to change the royal
robe for the monkish cowl. Their long hair was cut off
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and dedicated to the apostle, and after living as monks
under the shadow of the Vatican, they received a grave
in the atrium of the Basilica, as a pledge that they had
entered the company of the saints. It was not long
before Rome had a Saxon colony in the neighbourhood
of the Vatican.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sergius raised a monument to St. Leo the Great in St.
Peter's itself. It was the first example, as hitherto the
Popes had either been buried in the cemeteries outside
the walls or in the atrium of the Basilica. But from the
time that in 688 Pope Sergius had translated the body
of St. Leo into the transept itself, and raised an altar
over it, other very distinguished Popes received the like
honour.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But Pope Sergius also received a special messenger
from his lord Justinian II. He had sent the canons of
the eastern Council of 692, held in his palace, to the
Pope, requesting him to sign them on the line left
vacant between his own signature and that of his
patriarch. The Greeks were above all things anxious to
obtain their acceptance by the Pope. This was refused
by Pope Sergius, who forbade the acts of the Council to
be published. Upon this the emperor sent a high officer
to Rome, who carried off to Constantinople John, bishop
of Porto, and Boniface, counsellor of the apostolic see.
But he did not stop with this. He sent likewise the
captain of his guards, Zacharias, with orders to seize the
Pope and deport him to Constantinople.<a id="noteref_148" name="noteref_148" href="#note_148"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">148</span></span></a> But by the
mercy of God, and help of Peter, prince of the apostles,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
who guarded his own Church, the heart of the army of
Ravenna, and also of the duchy of Pentapolis (that is
the five cities, Ancona, Umana, Pesaro, Fano, and
Rimini), was moved not to allow the Pontiff of the
Apostolic See to go up to the royal city. And when the
soldiers had assembled in a multitude from all sides,
Zacharias the guardsman, in fear and trepidation lest he
should be killed by the angry crowd, besought the Pope
that the gates might be closed, but he himself took
refuge with the Pope, and besought him with tears, that
he would take pity on him and not suffer him to be
killed. Now the army of Ravenna had entered by St.
Peter's gate, and reached the Lateran palace in its
ardour to catch sight of the Pope, who was said to have
been taken away in the night, and put in a vessel. The
gates of the palace, both upper and lower, had been shut.
They threatened to tear them down unless they were
opened. The guardsman Zacharias, in his extreme
terror and despair, had crept under the Pope's bed. He
had lost his senses, but the Pope comforted him, and
came out and seated himself on the basilic of St.
Sebastian, in the seat called <span class="tei tei-q">“under the apostles,”</span> where
with mild words he turned away the wrath of the soldiers
and people, but they would not leave the palace until
with mocks and gibes they had turned the guardsman
out of Rome.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So after forty years Justinian II. had repeated the
worst deed of his grandfather Constans. Had Pope
Sergius been taken to Constantinople the same lot
awaited him there as had befallen his martyred predecessor
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Pope Martin. Yet in the interval the emperor's
own father had acknowledged in the amplest terms the
authority of St. Peter's successor. But the people of
Rome as well as the emperor's own army at Ravenna
and in central Italy had learnt rather to defend the Pope
than to yield to an unjust outrage.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Justinian, at this time beaten in the field by
Saracens and Bulgarians, was anxious to improve the
beauty of his palace, by constructing a magnificent
fountain and esplanade, from which he could better view
the party of the Blues which he favoured. Now a church
stood in the way of this enlargement, and he called upon
Callinicus, who had succeeded Paul as patriarch in 693,
to use the prayers customary when a church was pulled
down. The patriarch replied that he had prayers for the
building of churches, but none for their demolition.
The emperor insisted, and Callinicus so far yielded as
to use the prayer, <span class="tei tei-q">“Glory be to God, now and for ever
more, who allows and endures even this”</span>. After which
the church was pulled down.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Three years afterwards the tyranny of Justinian met
with its reward. He had prepared a massacre, in which
also the patriarch would have been included. The
patrician Leontius, a general of merit, had been imprisoned
for some years. He was set free and ordered
to Greece. On his way he lamented his fate to some
friends. They advised him to rise against the emperor.
He presented himself at the prætorium, gained admission
in the emperor's name, overpowered the officer in command,
set free the prisoners under his charge, some of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the best men in the city who had been confined there
for six or even eight years. Leontius then with his
friends marched through the streets, inviting all
Christians to Sancta Sophia. He went to the patriarch
who knew that he was involved in the sentence of death
intended by Justinian. The patriarch accompanied
Leontius to the baptistery where a great multitude
had assembled and uttered these words: <span class="tei tei-q">“This is the
day which the Lord has made”</span>. It became the signal
for a general insurrection. The people rushed to the
hippodrome. Thither in the morning Justinian was
brought. His nose and tongue were both maimed, and
he was banished to the Crimea. And Leontius reigned
in his stead.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But Leontius was not fortunate in war. He had
dethroned by this sudden revolution the fifth sovereign
in the line of Heraclius. In three years an army which
dreaded punishment because it had not saved Carthage
from the Saracens rebelled against him; he was deposed
by another officer, Apsimar or Tiberius II., who lasted
seven years from 698 to 705. At that time the banished
and maimed Justinian was enabled by help of the
Bulgarians to recover possession of Constantinople.<a id="noteref_149" name="noteref_149" href="#note_149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">149</span></span></a> Then began the time of vengeance not only on the two
usurpers, as he deemed them, who had sat between them
ten years on his throne, but on all who had supported
them. Leontius and Apsimar were carried in chains
through all the streets. Then, as the games in the
circus were proceeding and the people crowding to them,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they were thrown prostrate before the emperor who was
seen seated with a foot on the neck of each, while the
crowd as they went by shouted, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou hast trodden
upon the asp and the basilisk, and trampled on the
lion and the dragon”</span>. When the games were over
Justinian removed his foot from the necks of his fallen
rivals, and dismissed them to be beheaded. The patriarch
Callinicus he deprived of sight, and banished to
Rome, and put in his stead Cyrus, a monk, who had
foretold his restoration. He slew a vast multitude of
civilians and soldiers. He tied men up in sacks, and threw
them into the sea. He invited men to a great banquet,
and as they rose from it had them hung or beheaded.
In the meantime, while these events took place at Constantinople,
Pope Sergius had closed in honour his
pontificate of thirteen years and eight months, in
September, 701. The native soldiers of Italy had defended
him against the attempt of Justinian, and during
all his pontificate he refused to recognise the Trullan
canons. He was succeeded in less than two months by
another Greek, Pope John VI. At the time Tiberius
Apsimar was emperor, having dethroned Leontius. He
ordered his exarch Theophylact to proceed to Rome. He
was supposed to come with a bad intent against the
Pope. Italian troops from the provinces flocked to
Rome, and the city also rose against him. The Pope
again, as in the time of Pope Sergius, ordered the gates
to be closed; induced the Italians to retire from Rome,
and saved the exarch. Without troops himself he
possessed a greater influence over the Italians than the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
exarch. This Pope also induced the Lombard Duke of
Beneventum to retire from an attack on Campania, in
which he had done much harm. Pope John from the
treasury of the Church redeemed his captives. We hear
nothing of the exarch giving help either to defend or to
ransom the emperor's subjects.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After little more than three years John VI. was
succeeded by another Greek, John VII. He was consecrated
in March, 705. In the autumn of that year
Justinian II. regained his throne. He sent at once two
Metropolitans to Rome, to urge the Pope to accept the
Trullan canons. The Pope returned the canons in
silence. He did not accept the Council of 692 any more
than his predecessors. He died in 707, and was followed
by Sisinnius, a Syrian, who sat but 20 days, and his
successor Constantine, also a Syrian, was consecrated in
March, 708, the seventh Pope in succession who came
from Syria or the Greek empire.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the year 709, Justinian II. wreaked his vengeance
on Ravenna, stored up during the ten years of his banishment,
whether it was that their opposition with that of
Pope Sergius had rankled in his mind, or that they had
rejoiced at his fall, or, at any rate, that they had not
been faithful to him. Now, at length, he sent the
patrician Theodore, who commanded the army in Sicily,
with a fleet against them. The chief people of the city,
including the archbishop Felix, were enticed by the
general to his ship, where they were received by twos
in his tent. They were then seized, gagged, and put
into confinement below. The Greeks landed, burned
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and plundered the city, and killed many. The chief
captives were carried to Byzantium, and brought before
the emperor, who sat on a throne studded with emeralds,
and wore a diadem of pearls embroidered with
gold. As soon as he saw them, he ordered them to
execution, contenting himself with only blinding archbishop
Felix, and banishing him to Pontus.<a id="noteref_150" name="noteref_150" href="#note_150"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">150</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Intense was the hatred of Byzantium kindled in
Italy by such deeds.<a id="noteref_151" name="noteref_151" href="#note_151"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">151</span></span></a> It was at this time that
Justinian II., by an imperial letter, summoned Pope
Constantine to his capital. The Pope obeyed the
command, and set sail from Porto on the 10th October,
710, accompanied by a considerable attendance. After
he had left Rome, the exarch, John Rhizocapus, came,
in the emperor's name, to Rome, and put to death four
of the chief officers of the papal court, and <span class="tei tei-q">“going to
Ravenna, there for his most foul misdeeds perished by
a most ignominious death”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pope Constantine passed by Naples and Sicily, and
wintered at Otranto. Here he received an imperial
order, requiring the magistrates to treat him wherever
he went with the same honour as the emperor himself.
When he reached Constantinople, the young son of the
emperor, the highest nobility, the patriarch Cyrus,
with the clergy, and a great multitude, came out seven
miles to meet him. The Pope, wearing the dress which
he wore at Rome in great ceremonies, entered the city
with his train, riding the imperial horses richly caparisoned.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
They were taken in triumph first to the royal
palace, and then to the Pope's own abode at the Placidia
palace. Justinian, being at Nicæa, sent him a letter
full of thanks, and begged the Pope to meet him at
Nicomedia. When they met, the emperor, wearing his
crown, threw himself at the Pope's feet, and kissed
them. They then embraced to the great joy of the
people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It appears that the Deacon Gregory,<a id="noteref_152" name="noteref_152" href="#note_152"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">152</span></span></a> the next successor
of Pope Constantine, was attending on him, and
that he answered with great ability certain questions
put by the emperor. They are supposed to have referred
to the Trullan canons. They were not confirmed. The
later practice<a id="noteref_153" name="noteref_153" href="#note_153"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">153</span></span></a> of the Roman Church, with regard to
these canons, continued to be to suffer those only to
hold, which were not contrary to the decrees of the
Popes and the western discipline. On the Sunday, the
Pope celebrated Mass before the emperor, who received
Communion from him; besought him to pray that his
sins might be forgiven, renewed all the privileges of the
Roman Church, and left the Pope free, to return home.
That return was delayed by the frequent sicknesses of
the Pope. At length, however, he reached Gaeta in
safety, where a great number of clergy and of the Roman
people met him, and he entered Rome in joy in
October, 711.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the Pope had left behind him, and counselled in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
vain, an emperor bent on his own destruction. Justinian
had conceived a furious hatred against the town of
Cherson. He had sent a large fleet against it. Its
chief men were taken away and cruelly tortured. The
fleet itself was afterwards utterly wrecked by a tempest:
upon which Justinian prepared another, under fresh
commanders, who were instructed to inflict fresh cruelties.
In the end the people of Cherson was driven
into revolt. They proclaimed emperor Bardanes, one
of the commanders of the fleet. Another officer, a
chamberlain of Justinian, whom he had frightfully
injured, and who expected to be killed by him, joined
in the revolt. He was sent by Bardanes to seize Justinian,
persuaded the soldiers to desert him, fell upon
him, and, with his sword, cut off his head, which he
sent at once to Bardanes, who forthwith despatched it
by the same soldier to Rome. And thus the extinction
of the race of Heraclius was signified to the West by
the exposure of his head. His only son, Tiberius, a
boy of ten, had already been slaughtered like a sheep.<a id="noteref_154" name="noteref_154" href="#note_154"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">154</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus it was that Pope Constantine, three months
after his return to Rome, received tidings that Justinian
was killed, and that Philippicus Bardanes had taken his
place. In these days<a id="noteref_155" name="noteref_155" href="#note_155"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">155</span></span></a>
theology had so penetrated
every relation of life that every emperor, on his accession,
was accustomed to send his profession of belief to
the highest bishops of his empire. That of Philippicus
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
unhappily signified to the Pope that he was a Monothelite.
Thereupon Pope Constantine, in council, refused
to accept his letter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In fact, the Armenian officer who had at length put
an end to the life and crimes of Justinian II., had no
sooner obtained recognition as emperor, than he resolved
to overthrow the Sixth Council, and establish the heresy
which it had condemned. In the year and a-half, during
which he reigned, he caused a council to meet at Constantinople.
He deposed the patriarch Cyrus, who
would not yield to his wishes: and put in his place the
deacon, John, who was more submissive. This council,
whose Acts were buried with the emperor, and whose
numbers are not known, ordered the Monothelite
heresy to be subscribed by all. Most of the bishops,
with miserable cowardice, gave way to the will of the
court. Among the number is said to have been even
Germanus, then archbishop of Cyzicus, and afterwards,
as patriarch of Constantinople, a firm defender of the
faith. Only a few bishops, like Zeno of Sinope, resisted.
The copy of the Acts of the Sixth Council, kept in the
palace, was burnt. At Rome, the Pope's rejection of
the new emperor's creed was taken up by the people
with the utmost zeal. They would not receive his
image in the church, nor bear the mention of his name
in the Mass, nor tolerate his coin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, in eighteen months, his own profligate life
caused him to be deposed. Two officers of high rank,
one of them commanding the forces in the neighbouring
provinces, determined to rid the empire of such a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
master. An emissary of theirs, entering on Whitsun eve
suddenly by the golden gate, with a company of
soldiers, gained admittance to the emperor's chamber,
and carried him off unconscious from the effect of a
drunken carouse on his birthday. They took him to
the hippodrome, and there blinded him. On the next
day, being Pentecost, the people were assembled in the
great church, and Artemius, the first secretary, was
crowned, and his name changed to Anastasius. On the
following Saturday, he punished with blindness the two
conspirators who had so treated his predecessor.<a id="noteref_156" name="noteref_156" href="#note_156"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">156</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus Rome and the East were suddenly delivered
from a revolution which had fallen upon them with
equal suddenness, a fresh domination of the Monothelite
heresy. All acts done by the government of the fallen
Philippicus were annulled, and the Sixth Council
solemnly proclaimed afresh by clergy and people at
Rome. There was great rejoicing at the fall of Philippicus,
and the rise of Anastasius, who sent to the Pope
a letter containing his orthodox belief.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is to be noted also that the patriarch of Constantinople,
John VI., who had been put into the place of
Cyrus by Philippicus, had joined in the emperor's acts
against the Sixth Council, and led the council which
rejected it, now wrote to Pope Constantine to excuse
himself for having yielded to force. He began the letter
with these words:—<a id="noteref_157" name="noteref_157" href="#note_157"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">157</span></span></a>
</p>


<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“God, who has constructed the magnificence of visible
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
things as a mark of His own Godhead and power, has
specially in the formation of man, the most honoured of
the sensible creation, shown His glory and wisdom, so
that the prophet cried out, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Such knowledge is too
wonderful for me’</span>. Now, the Maker of our nature,
designing the head to be over the whole body, placed in
it the most important of our senses, and caused all the
movement and perfection of the other limbs to spring
from it, and be preserved in it. If one of these meet
with loss or injury, it is not left without care, but the
head shows a natural sympathy even to the extremest
parts of the body, and heals the local suffering by the
hand's ministry and the eye's guidance, the aid of which
it does not refuse as useless. With this we can compare
your own apostolical pre-eminence, counting you, according
to the canons, as the head of the Christian priesthood.<a id="noteref_158" name="noteref_158" href="#note_158"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">158</span></span></a>
And so with reason we ask of you to be released
from the discouragement which has fallen on the body
of the Church by the pestilent exercise of tyrannical
power.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The patriarch further beseeches the Pope to pardon
his fault that under this stress he had rejected the
doctrine of the Sixth Council, in the words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Since you
are the disciple and the successor of him who heard from
the Lord, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Simon, Simon, behold Satan has sought to
sift you as wheat, but I have prayed for thee that thy
faith fail not: and thou when thou art converted confirm
thy brethren,’</span> you are a debtor to supply what is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
needed for the correction which confirms, and also to
show a sympathetic kindness”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pope Constantine is the fifth and also the last Pope
who paid a visit to Constantinople. As these visits cast
an important light upon the condition during two
hundred years under which, being acknowledged as
successors of St. Peter, they exercised as subjects in the
civil order their supreme authority in the Church, I
think it belongs to the matter now treated to refer to the
facts and results of each visit. Pope John I., who sat
from 523 to 525, was a subject of King Theodorich, and
was summoned by him to Ravenna. There he was
compelled, much against his will, to go with three
senators on an embassy to the emperor Justin I.
Theodorich was most indignant that the emperor had
required Arians in his empire to give back their churches
to the Catholics. He threatened the Pope that if this
treatment was not reversed he would drown Italy in
blood.<a id="noteref_159" name="noteref_159" href="#note_159"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">159</span></span></a> So the Pope, being sick, went with the senators
to Constantinople. On their arrival the whole city went
out with wax lights and bannered crosses in honour
of the blessed Apostles, Peter and Paul, for the Greeks
testified that from the time of Constantine and St.
Silvester they had never merited to receive a successor
of St. Peter. Then the emperor Justin, doing honour
to God, threw himself to the ground upon his face and
worshipped the most blessed Pope John. Pope John and
the senators besought him with many tears to accept
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a name="Pg285" id="Pg285" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their legation. The emperor rejoiced that he had been
found worthy to see in his kingdom a successor of St.
Peter and was gloriously crowned by his hands.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When they returned with success to King Theodorich
at Ravenna they found that he had imprisoned the two
illustrious senators, Symmachus and Boethius; he put
the Pope likewise in prison, and so the bishop of the
first see suffered affliction in ward, and died of want.
Ninety-eight days after his death in prison the heretical
King Theodorich by the will of God suddenly died.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ten years after this, in 535, the same Book of the
Popes records that Pope Agapetus, being the subject of
Theodatus, King of the Goths, was sent by him on
embassy to the emperor Justinian. Theodatus had put
to death the Queen Amalasunta, daughter of Theodorich,
who had herself given him the crown. He hoped that
the Pope might save him with the emperor. The Pope
was received with all distinction. But he found a heretic
seated on the see of the capital, whose orthodoxy the
emperor defended. And the emperor said to the Pope,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Either agree with us or I will have you banished”</span>.
The Pope replied: <span class="tei tei-q">“Sinner that I am, I came to Constantinople
to see the most Christian Emperor Justinian. I
find instead a Diocletian. But I do not fear your threats.
But that you may know that your bishop does not belong
to the Christian religion, let him confess there to be Two
Natures in Christ.”</span> Then the Bishop Anthimus, being
cited by the emperor, would never confess in answer
to the question of Pope Agapetus that there are Two
Natures in our Lord Jesus Christ. So the Pope prevailed.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg 286]</span><a name="Pg286" id="Pg286" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The emperor with joy submitted himself to the Holy
See, and worshipped Pope Agapetus; he expelled
Anthimus from his communion and banished him, and
besought the Pope to consecrate Mennas in his stead.
This was done. The Pope was taken ill, and died after
two months at Constantinople. He was buried with a
greater concourse of people than had ever attended the
funeral of emperor or bishop. His body was carried back in triumph
to Rome and buried at St. Peter's.<a id="noteref_160" name="noteref_160" href="#note_160"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">160</span></span></a>

Shortly after Justinian added the direct sovereignty
of conquest to that respect, whatever its extent may
have been, with which Rome and the Popes regarded
the sole emperor who since the abolition of the western
emperor in 476 represented the Roman name, though
seated on the Bosphorus. Pope Vigilius in 547 was
his subject, and as such summoned by him to Constantinople,
whither he went with the same reluctance as his
two predecessors at the command of Theodorich and
Theodatus. The emperor's purpose was to force the
Pope to set his seal upon a doctrinal edict of his own.
At first Justinian humbly besought his blessing, and
embraced him with tears. But this soon turned to persecution,
and seven years of perpetual humiliation for
the Pope followed. Deceived, isolated, imprisoned, deserted,
he did not surrender the faith. St. Peter in his
person was not overcome, but he was discredited, and it
required forty years, crowned by the wisdom and fortitude
of St. Gregory, to restore the full lustre of the Holy
See.

After a hundred years and a succession of fourteen
Popes, St. Martin held a great Council at Rome in 649,
in which he passed anathema upon the heresy of two
eastern emperors, grandfather and grandson. In requital
for this the grandson had him seized in his Lateran
Church itself, carried secretly to Constantinople, judged
by the senate there for high treason, condemned to
death, and finally suffered him to die of starvation in the
Crimea. As Pope John I. gained his crown of martyrdom
by the first visit of a Pope to Constantinople, so
Pope Martin gained the like crown by the fourth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
About thirty years after this a General Council was
held in which the heresy which St. Martin had placed
under ban was condemned afresh; and it was called by
the wish and command of the then reigning emperor,
son of the very man who had persecuted St. Martin to
death, and in it the largest acknowledgments of St.
Peter's succession at Rome were made to St. Martin's
successors.

Yet, ten years afterwards, this man's son, then
emperor, tried to repeat upon Pope Sergius the crime
of the grandfather committed on Pope St. Martin. That
his attempt was baffled, the life of his messenger saved
by Pope Sergius, and the messenger dismissed in most
ignominious flight, was owing to the Italian troops of
the emperor rising in defence of the Pope. They would
not allow him to be taken to the capital on the Bosphorus.

frustrated by the flocking of Italian troops to Rome in
defence of the Pope.

Last is the visit of Pope Constantine, in which two
things are remarkable. The very emperor who had
attempted to kidnap Pope Sergius in 693, being on the
eve of the extinction which was to fall on the line of
Heraclius, in 710 invited Pope Constantine to visit him,
ordered him everywhere to be received with royal
honours; when they met, fell, though crowned, at his
feet to kiss them, and sent him back in highest honour.
And presently the patriarch of Constantinople, begging
of him to be condoned for a grievous fault, drew a picture
of his supremacy the functions of which he compared
to those which the Creator in His wisdom has
given to the head in the human body. I will venture
to say that no western mind has expressed with greater
force or tenderness the office which belongs to him who
sits in the see of the chief apostle than was done by the
tenant for the time of that see of New Rome, which for
more than three centuries had been striving to rival and
depress the elder Rome.

The emperor Anastasius, so strangely chosen from a
first secretary to succeed a fallen usurper, and undo his
establishment of heresy, was both orthodox and blameless
in conduct, and strove to defend his much endangered
empire. He had armed a fleet, but it rebelled
and killed its commander. The end of a civil war,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg 289]</span><a name="Pg289" id="Pg289" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
lasting six months, was that Anastasius retired of his

he became a monk and priest and was banished to
Thessalonica. He had reigned two years and a half.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Anastasius, some time after his retirement, made,
when Leo III. was established on the throne, an attempt
to regain it. For this he was publicly executed at
Constantinople. So he was added to his predecessors,
Leontius, Apsimar, and Justinian II., making the fourth

of Leo III. in 717, to whom the throne was a

Theodosius III., a good man but an incapable ruler,
had in vain tried to escape the crown imposed on him
by the rebellious fleet. After a year the general of the
army of the East, a soldier of great capacity and vigour,
was advancing to dethrone him. The senate and
patriarch advised him to resign. His private property
was secured to him on condition that both he and his
son became priests. Theodosius III. yielded possession
of a throne from acquiring which he had fled, and lived
in peace at Ephesus. He gave himself up to good
works, and when he was buried in St. Philip's Church he
had ordered the single word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">health</span></em> to be engraven on

Between the two Popes St. Gregory I. and St. Gregory
II. lies a period of 111 years, marked with disasters to
the Christian people and religion such as no preceding
century can show. At the death of St. Gregory I. in
604, all the shores of the Mediterranean were in possession
of Christians. The authority of the eastern
emperor extended from Constantinople over Asia
Minor, Syria, and the region up to the Euphrates,
Egypt, and the long range of Northern Africa, embracing
the present Tripoli, Tunis, Algiers, and Morocco, to
the Atlantic. The beginning of Christian kingdoms,
looking up with filial affection to their spiritual Father
in Rome, was apparent to the eye of the first Gregory.
Gaul and Spain and Africa, lately recovered by Justinian,
had a network of spiritual provinces, in which each
Metropolitan received from Rome the pallium, the token
of apostolic authority and unity. St. Gregory himself
had added to these by the mission of Augustine, and the
chair of unity founded at Canterbury. Full as these
countries were of violence, mutual aggression, and unsubdued
ferocity, the Teutonic invaders had nevertheless
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
accepted the law of Christ from Rome, and the first
principles of human order had been fused with their
natural traditions of freedom. Above all, the Arian
heresy had been dispossessed, and there was no appearance
of a religion counter to the Christian arising. In
every city of a vast region the bishop was regarded by
his people with veneration, the very source of which lay
in a power which he held by imposition of hands. A
spiritual head to those around him, he was himself a
link in the chain of that universal hierarchy the head
of which was at Rome.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the accession of Gregory II. the whole coast line
from Cilicia at least to Mauritania on the Atlantic,
had been lost to the Roman empire, and in a very great
degree to the Christian Church as well. It was all now
in the occupation of a single power, the head of which
was termed the successor. The successor that is of the
Arabian who had set himself in the place of Christ, who
had conquered the Christians in this vast range of
territory, and would allow them to live only on tenure
of subjection. Instead of the remnant of primeval
tradition which formed the mythology and influenced
the customs of the northern tribes at the time of their
descent on the western empire, the Arabian prophet and
his successors had impregnated their people with a
furious and fanatical belief to be imposed by force.
It was a chief part of that belief that it ought to be
imposed by force on all outside. And they who fell in
such a holy war were held to be martyrs, as indeed they
witnessed and imitated the life of Mohammed from the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
time of the Hegira. Thus the possession of the world
was attached to the profession of one God and Mohammed
as his prophet. In the century next after the death
of the prophet those who retrace the deeds of his
followers must admit that every possible disregard of
human life and of the things most hallowed in Christian
society had been shown by them in the construction of
a kingdom now stretching from the Atlantic to the
Indus. The religion under whose inspiration all this
had been done, was framed in essential antagonism to the
Christian faith. For indeed the mystery on which the
Christian faith rested, that the Son of God had assumed
human nature for the redemption of man, was denounced
by it as derogatory to the very conception of God.
Mohammedans proscribed Christians as associators of a
creature with the Creator. This association they called
idolatry. The northern wandering of the nations might
receive Christian belief and be formed into a Christendom.
The southern wandering of the nations, since it
rested on a prophet the personal antagonist of the
Christian founder, could only substitute Islamieh for
Christendom.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This it had done over the empire which as we have
seen was constructed at the time St. Gregory II. became
Pope, and Leo III. after six revolutions became emperor
at Constantinople.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Between the two Gregories twenty-four Popes occupied
the throne of St. Peter, from Pope Sabinian to Pope
Constantine. Of these three only, Honorius, Vitalian,
and Sergius, sat over ten years each; the three together
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
occupied forty-one years, leaving seventy years in the
gross for the remaining twenty-one pontificates. But a
considerable portion of these years must be deducted
for the time which intervened between their election, and
the allowing of their consecration by the consent of the
emperor or the exarch as his viceroy. In that interval
Greek arts were applied, to induce the Pope elect to consent
to some thing desired by the emperor. Thus Pope
Severinus on the death of Honorius was kept out of his
see for nineteen months and sixteen days, to obtain, if
possible, his consent to the doctrine put forth by
Heraclius in the Ecthesis. In this manner the pontificate
of Severinus was reduced to two months and three days,
in which he found time to condemn the emperor's
Ecthesis. So again on the election of St. Sergius in 687,
the exarch hurried down from Ravenna to prevent it if
possible; but he was too late, and could only plunder
the Church's treasury of one hundred pounds weight of
gold. These are samples, but the action continued over
the whole period. Historians remark that the seven last
Popes who sat during it were all Greeks, and conclude
that the emperors thought compliance might be hoped for
in such cases. This series of seven began with John VI.
in 685. The seven Popes were all faithful not to the
exacting demands of emperors, but to the charge of St.
Peter, and during the thirty years in which they occupied
the Holy See seven revolutions of emperors took place at
Constantinople. Three emperors perished by public
execution; a fourth was only blinded; a fifth having
become a priest, and attempted to regain the throne was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
then executed as a traitor by its actual tenant. The
worst of the six was the fifth emperor in the line of
Heraclius, whose head was sent to Rome as a ghastly
but indisputable witness that Italy was delivered from
his tyranny.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During the whole one hundred and eleven years Italy
was governed as a province which had no civil rights.
I recur to the words of St. Agatho in his letter<a id="noteref_162" name="noteref_162" href="#note_162"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">162</span></span></a> to the
Sixth Council for the importance of his acknowledging
the sad condition of learning, as a result of the miserable
danger and uncertainty of the time. Not often does a
Pope say of his own legates, <span class="tei tei-q">“How should they who
gained their daily bread by manual labour with the
utmost hazard, possess accurate and abundant learning?”</span>
But he gave assurance that <span class="tei tei-q">“with simplicity of
heart and without faltering they maintained the faith
handed down from their fathers, making their one and
their chief good that nothing should be diminished,
nothing changed, but the words and the meaning both
kept untouched”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whatever pomp and glory remained to the empire
was centered in Constantinople. Rome and the Pope
were powerless as to material strength. So St. Martin,
when accused at his trial of favouring an enemy of the
emperor, replied: <span class="tei tei-q">“What was I to resist an exarch, without
any force of my own?”</span> At that time Constantinople
was probably the greatest as well as the richest city in
the world. When Constans II. eight years after visited
Rome he swept away whatever works of art pleased him
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg 295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for the further adornment of his capital. In the four
centuries down to Leo III. which elapsed since the consecration
of the capital by its founder, every successor
had made it a point of honour to improve the beauty
and increase the strength of the imperial residence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus those twenty-four Popes from the first to the
second Gregory were dwelling in a Rome which continued
to exist only as the seat of their own primacy,
drawing successive generations to it, and visited year by
year through the pilgrims who came to it from all parts
of the world, since they sought the tomb of the chief
apostle when the sepulchre of the Master was enthralled
by the Saracen. Beside that tomb they stood with
Roman fortitude against Byzantine fluctuation. Heraclius
published an Ecthesis, and Constans II. a Typus. Ten
Popes condemned both, and then Constantine IV.
humbly admitted that both were worthless. He further
undid the heresy of four successive patriarchs by putting
them under anathema. He received as the living Peter
the successor of one whom his father had stolen from
Rome and martyred in the Crimea; just as his son
Justinian fell at the feet of Pope Constantine, after
he had tried to repeat the crime of his grandfather
Constans on the person of Pope Sergius. So in 680
Theodore, then patriarch of Constantinople, urged on by
another patriarch who lived at Constantinople since his
own Antioch was become a spoil of the Saracen, expunged
from the diptychs the names of all the Popes
after Honorius to his own time. Theodore was himself
deposed while the Sixth Council sat, and Macarius, his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
adviser, was deposed by that Council, but Theodore
lived to be restored and to die as patriarch with a
sounder faith than he had shown at the beginning. It
is remarkable that after the four Monothelite patriarchs,
Sergius, Pyrrhus, Paul, and Peter, who were condemned
at the Sixth Council, three patriarchs, Thomas II., 667-8,
John V., 669-674, and Constantine I., 674-6,<a id="noteref_163" name="noteref_163" href="#note_163"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">163</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“leant to
orthodoxy,”</span> and so escaped the censure of the Council,
while Theodore was heretical from 678 to 680, and
orthodox when restored from 683 to 686.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thirty years after the Sixth Council the patriarch,
John V., after presiding at the council summoned by the
Emperor Philippicus, who attempted by it to re-establish
the Monothelite heresy, besought pardon of Pope Constantine
as the head whose function it was to heal all the
wounds of the body. I know not what proof of the
Roman primacy surpasses in force, to those who
have eyes to see, this proof arising from the alternate
persecution and confession of Byzantine emperors and
patriarchs, compared with the unbending fortitude and
unalterable faith of the twenty-four Popes in that long
century when Rome served as a slave in the natural
order, and was worshipped in the spiritual kingdom
as a sanctuary.

The Sixth General Council had been held in 680, and
on the union of the East and West the long and obstinate
Monothelite heresy had seemed to be extinguished with
all the authority wielded by the Pope at the head of a
General Council. Yet thirty years after this event the
fifth emperor of the line of Heraclius was dethroned and
beheaded by a usurper; and the first act of the insurgent
when seated on the throne of Constantine was to
call a council of his own eastern bishops at Constantinople,
which at his command attempted to abrogate the
Sixth Council and to set up again as the proper faith of
the Church the heresy which it had condemned. And
this act of Philippicus Bardanes met with nothing like
an adequate resistance from the eastern bishops. It is
true that the patriarch Cyrus, refusing to comply with
the wishes of the new emperor, was deposed by him, and
a more obsequious successor, the deacon John, put in his
place. But even Germanus, then archbishop of Cyzicus,
yielded to the storm, and thus a bishop of imperial blood,
who four years afterwards was himself placed in the see
of Constantinople, who held it during fifteen years, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

No incident can show more plainly the pretensions of
the eastern emperor and the weakness of the eastern
bishops than the fact that the first act of an Armenian
officer when he had, by the murder of his sovereign, put
on the imperial buskins on which the eagle of the Roman
power was embroidered, consisted in an attempt to alter
the faith of the Church, and that the alteration was
supported by the bishops whom he had convened.
Philippicus himself was a worthless sensualist, whose
reign was put an end to in eighteen months by another
revolution. Two more transient emperors passed to the
dishonoured throne, and then appeared a third, who
reigned twenty-four years, and has left his mark on
history.

Leo III. was a soldier of great courage and considerable
skill. He was of low birth in the province of
Isauria, but worked his way through the various grades
of the army until he became the most highly reputed
of its generals at a moment when a succession of seven
revolutions had seemed to portend the coming extinction
of the empire. Besides its internal dissensions, it was
hard pressed by the chalif Solomon, who was making
every preparation for the final conquest of the capital.
When by the cession of the good but impotent Theodosius
III. the Isaurian officer obtained the crown, sodden
as it were with the blood of three successive emperors, it
might have seemed that the last hour had come of the

sufficient bulwark against the Mohammedan torrent of
conquest. Leo III. thought not so. His first act was
to defeat the chalif and cast back his invading host.
The eastern empire breathed afresh under his resolute
spirit and strategic skill, and learnt to meet not
ingloriously the Saracen in battle. Ten years of success
had given to its ruler some rays of the glory which had
shone upon the older emperors.

It is of the year 726 that the most learned of Italian
historians<a id="noteref_164" name="noteref_164" href="#note_164"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">164</span></span></a> speaks in these words: <span class="tei tei-q">“This year Leo, the
Isaurian, began a tragedy which convulsed the Church of
God and laid the foundations for the loss of Italy to the
Greek emperors. Theophanes, Nicephorus, and other
historians tell us that a submarine volcano had broken
out in the Ægean Sea and cast up a quantity of pumice
stone on the adjoining coast. This natural incident had
produced the greatest alarm. Moreover, a perfidious
renegade named Bezer,<a id="noteref_165" name="noteref_165" href="#note_165"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">165</span></span></a> who had embraced the Arabian
superstition, had nestled himself in the imperial court,
and succeeded in making the emperor believe that God
was enraged with the Christians on account of the images
which they had in their churches and venerated. No
doubt abuses did exist in the veneration of these images,
as have since appeared among the Moscovites, united
to the Greek Church. But such abuses neither were
nor are a reason to abolish these images, for, as men of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
great knowledge have proved, the use of images and a
well-regulated veneration of them is not only lawful, but
greatly fosters piety in the Christian Catholic people.
Now the emperor Leo, infatuated by his own great
penetration of mind and seduced by this evil counsellor,
practised a usurpation upon the rights of the priesthood,
and published an edict ordering that from that
moment all the sacred images should be forbidden and
removed through the territory of the Roman empire.
He called the kissing them or venerating them idolatry.
This was the beginning of the Iconoclast heresy. This
rash and iniquitous prohibition excited great commotion
among his subjects. The larger part detested him as
heretical, as holding Mohammedan sentiments, and the
more because it was known that he held in abomination
the sacred relics, and denied the intercession of the saints
with God—that is, attacked beliefs established in the
Church of God. He also impugned thereby the profession
of faith which he had made when he assumed the
imperial throne, refusing to listen to the judgment of
bishops who are chosen by God for guardians of the
doctrine which belongs to the faith. Though we have
not the letters written by him to Pope Gregory II. about
abolishing the sacred images, and the pontiff's answers
to him, yet the sequel plainly shows that he sent to
Rome the above-named edict, and that the holy pontiff
not only opposed it, but wrote with kindled feelings
to the emperor about it, inducing him to give up this
sacrilegious design.”</span>

shortly after, which present to us the clearest and most
authentic picture of the Iconoclast contest. Both the
contention of the emperor and the censure of the pontiff

In the person of St. Gregory II., after several Popes of
eastern descent, a Roman had again reached the pontificate.<a id="noteref_166" name="noteref_166" href="#note_166"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">166</span></span></a> He was acquainted with Constantinople, to which
place he had accompanied his predecessor, Pope Constantine.
His experience in political things was as great as
his grasp of theological knowledge was firm. He had
dealt with Greeks and Lombards, not only in ecclesiastical
affairs, but as counsellor, as arbitrator, and as party
concerned in disputes. He adorned the churches of
Rome, but he likewise strengthened her fortifications
on the Esquiline. When, in the year 717, a considerable
portion of the city had been dangerously flooded, and in
the quarter of the Via Lata the water had risen eight-feet
high, the poor people found support and consolation
in the Pope. During many years there had been peace
between Church and Empire as also between the Roman
See and the patriarchate of the imperial capital. The
first years of Leo III. promised nothing but good. Born
of low birth in the mountains of Isauria, and destitute of
education, he had risen by his valour step by step, and
was in command of the Anatolian army when called to

succeed Theodosius III. His reign of four and twenty
years would have been fortunate had not the dogmatising
fancies which seemed to be inherited by the most
various natures on the Byzantine throne taken possession
of him. Through them he kindled a conflict which set
East and West in commotion, and completed the rent
between them.

It was about the year 727, the twelfth year of his own
pontificate, and ten years after the accession of Leo III.,
when the acts of the eastern emperor caused St. Gregory
II. to address the following letter to him.<a id="noteref_167" name="noteref_167" href="#note_167"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">167</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-q">“The letter of your God-protected majesty and
fraternity we have received by the augustal officer of
the Guards, and we likewise keep it securely in the holy
church close to the confession of the holy and glorious
Peter, prince of the apostles, where likewise are kept the
letters of your predecessors who reigned in the love of
Christ. In this letter you well and piously, as befits a
Christian emperor, professed that you would keep without
fail the injunctions of our holy fathers and teachers. It is
first, and remarkable, that the letter is yours and not another's,
sealed with the imperial seal, and subscribed within
in vermilion, by your own hand, as is the wont of emperors
to subscribe. Therein you professed with the
clearest piety our blameless and orthodox faith. You
wrote, <span class="tei tei-q">‘he who moves and pulls down the boundaries of
the fathers is execrable’</span>. On receiving this we uttered
hymns of thanksgiving to God, for God assuredly has
given you the throne. You were running well. Who
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg 303]</span><a name="Pg303" id="Pg303" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
then has rung an alarum in your ears, and perverted
your heart like a twisted bowstring, and turned your
eyes backwards? During ten years by the grace of God
you went well. You never spoke of the holy images.
Now you say they take the place of idols, and that those
who worship them are idolaters. And you are bent on
sweeping them away, and clearing the land of them.
And you fear not the judgment of God in bringing
scandals into the hearts of men, not of the faithful only,
but of the faithless too. Christ charges you not to
scandalise one of the little ones, and for a small offence
to depart into everlasting fire, and you have scandalised
the whole world, as if you could not endure death, nor
make an evil confession. You have written that <span class="tei tei-q">‘we
should not worship things made with hands, nor any
kind of likeness, as God said, neither in heaven nor on
earth; and show me, if you please, who has charged us
to reverence and worship things made with hands. Then
I will confess that is God's command’</span>. And why, you
that are emperor and head of Christians, did you not
enquire of those who had the knowledge of experience?
You might have been satisfied by them concerning what
things made by hands God spoke, before stirring up,
confounding, and disturbing humble people. But you
thrust away, and denied, and cast out our holy fathers
and teachers whom, with your own hand and in writing,
you professed to obey and follow. The holy and inspired
fathers and teachers are our scripture, our light and
our salvation. The six Councils held in Christ have
commanded us, and you do not accept their testimony.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
We are compelled to write to you in rude uncultured
words, since uncultured and rude you are. But truly
they carry the power and the truth of God. We entreat
you in God's name to cast aside the haughtiness and
pride which beset you, and gently and humbly give us
your attention. May God lead you to the truth of what
He has said. He was speaking of idolaters who had possession
of the promised land. They worshipped animals in
gold and silver and wood; they worshipped the whole
creation, and all winged birds. Their cry was, <span class="tei tei-q">‘These are
our gods and other god there is not’</span>. It was for these
devilish things, made by the hand, injurious and execrable,
that God condemned their worship. For since there are
things made with hands to the service and glory of God,
whose will it was to introduce His own holy people of
the Hebrews, as He foretold to Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob, to give them the land of promise, and to make
the Israelites possessors and inheritors of the possessions
of idolaters, and to crush and utterly wipe out those
generations because they had polluted the land and the
air by their transgressions, God warned His people beforehand
not to fall into their modes of worship. He selected
two men of the Israelite people, blessed and hallowed
them for the execution of works wrought by the hand, but
for the glory and service of God, as a memorial to those
generations, Bezaleel and Eliab, of the first tribe of Dan.
God said to Moses, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Cut out two tables of stone and bring
them to Me’</span>. He brought them, and God, with His own
finger, wrote upon them the ten life-giving and immortal
words. Then God said: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Make cherubim and seraphim,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and a table, and cover it within and without with gold:
and mark an ark of incorruptible wood, and put thy
testimonies into the ark for a memorial to your generations,
that is, the tablets, the urn, the rod, the manna’</span>.
Are these fashions and resemblances made by hand, or
are they not? But they are for the glory and service
of God. That great Moses, full of fear, in his desire to
see a likeness and resemblance, not to be deceived, besought
God, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Lord, show me Thyself manifestly,
that I may see Thee’</span>. And the Lord answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘If
thou seest Me, thou wilt die. But pass into the hole of
the rock, and thou shalt see My hind parts.’</span> God
showed to him in a vision the mystery hidden from the
beginning of the world. But in our generations, in the
last days, He showed Himself to us manifestly, both
His front and His hind part, entire. When God saw
the race of men perishing to the end, taking pity on
His own creation, He sent forth His Son, begotten
before time. And, coming down from heaven, He
entered the womb of the holy Virgin Mary. The true
Light shone forth in her womb, and, instead of human
generation, the Light became flesh. And He was baptised
in the River Jordan, and us also He baptised. He
began to give us pledges of knowledge, that we might
not be deceived. And, entering into Jerusalem, into
the Upper Chamber of holy and glorious Sion, to the
mystical supper, He delivered to us His holy Body, and
gave us to drink His precious Blood. There also He
washed our feet; we drank with Him, and we ate with
Him, and our hands felt Him, and He became our companion.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
And the Truth was manifested to us, and the
error and the mist which encompassed us fled away and
vanished. And their <span class="tei tei-q">‘voice went forth into all the
world, and their words to the end of the earth’</span>. Then
men from the whole world came flying as eagles to
Jerusalem, as the Lord said in the gospels, <span class="tei tei-q">‘wheresoever
the body shall be, there shall the eagles also be gathered
together’</span>. Christ is the Body: the high flying eagles
are men who worship God and love Christ. Those who
saw the Lord, as they saw Him, drew His portrait.
Those who saw James, the Lord's brother, as they saw
him, drew his portrait. Those who saw the proto-martyr,
Stephen, as they saw him, drew his portrait. In a
word, those who saw the faces of the martyrs who
poured forth their blood for Christ, drew them. And
men in all the world, beholding, gave up the worshipping
of the devil, and worshipped these not with absolute,
but with relative, worship. Which of the two
seems to you, O emperor, right, to worship: these images,
or those of the devil's error? When Christ was present
at Jerusalem, Augar, then king of the Edessenes, hearing
of His wonderful works, wrote to Christ: and
Christ, with His own hand, sent him an answer, and
His own holy and glorious face. Send to that not
made with hands, and behold it. Multitudes of eastern
peoples flock thither, and worship. Many other such
things not made with hands exist, which the hosts of
Christian pilgrims possess, whose daily worship you
overlook.<a id="noteref_168" name="noteref_168" href="#note_168"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">168</span></span></a>
Why do we not examine and depict the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page307">[pg 307]</span><a name="Pg307" id="Pg307" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ? Because we know
Him not, and it is impossible to examine and depict
the nature of God. Had we beheld and known Him
as we did His Son, Him also we might have examined
and depicted, and you might call His image, too, an
idol.</span>

into the truth, which you have left. Cast aside pride,
destroy your self-assurance, write to all and everywhere,
raise up again those whom you have scandalised and
blinded, though, insensible as you are, you hold this
for nothing. The charity of Christ knows that, when
we enter the church of the holy Prince of the Apostles,
and behold his portrait, compunction comes on us, and,
like rain from heaven, a flood of tears comes down.
Christ made the blind to see; you have blinded those
who saw well, and have made them stumble, little as
you think of it. You have reduced men to ignorance,
stopped their fair running, deprived them of their
prayers. Instead of vigils, prayerfulness, and zeal to
God, you have dissolved the poor population in sleepiness,
slumbering, and carelessness. They have lost
their head. And you say that we worship stones, and
walls, and boards. Not so, O emperor. But to rouse
memory and feeling, to raise up the dull, rude, and untaught
mind, by their names, their invocation, their
features. Not as gods, as you assert: far from it: for
we do not place our hopes in these things. If it be a

of God, help us and save us’</span>. If it be of His holy

our souls’</span>. If it be of a martyr, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Saint Stephen, who
didst shed thy blood for Christ, by thy confidence as
proto-martyr, intercede for us’</span>. So we say, in the
case of every martyr who suffered martyrdom. Suchlike
are the prayers which we address through them.
It is not, as you assert, O emperor, that we call the
martyrs gods. Put away those evil thoughts of yours.
I charge you, save your own soul from the scandals and
the imprecations which you receive from all the world:
for even the little children make a mock of you. Go
to the children's schools, and say, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I am he who pull
down and drive away pictures’</span>. They will answer
by throwing their slates at your head: and what
you have failed to learn from the wise, you will be
taught by the simple.</span>

temple, after eight hundred years, the brazen serpent:
so have I, after eight hundred years, expelled the idols
from the churches’</span>. Truly, Ozias was your brother, and
had your self-conceit, and tyrannised over the priests of
that day, just as you do. For holy David carried that
serpent into the temple with the sacred ark. What
was it but a brazen work consecrated by God for those
who were then suffering from the bite of serpents: that
an image might be shown to the people of the prime
suggester of sin to the first creature formed by God,
Adam and Eve, this was set up for the healing of sins.
But you, as you boast, after eight hundred years, have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a name="Pg309" id="Pg309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cast out from the churches the blessing and consecration
of the martyrs, and, as you fairly confessed at first, of
set purpose and without necessity, and, lastly, by the
subscription of your own hand, put upon your own head
their curse.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Now we, as holding supreme and undoubted authority
from St. Peter the chief, were minded to rebuke you, but
since you have brought the curse upon yourself, keep it
and share it with your advisers. See to what extent you
have broken in upon the edification and good course of
others. The charity of Christ knows this. When we
enter a church ourselves and behold the picture of our
Lord Jesus Christ's wonderful deeds and of His holy
Mother bearing in her arms and nursing our Lord and
our God, and the angels standing round them and chanting
the Holy, Holy, Holy, we do not leave that church
without compunction. And, again, who is not touched
with compunction and moved to tears when he beholds
the baptismal vessels and the circle of priests surrounding,
and the mystical supper, and the blind recovering their
sight, and the raising of Lazarus, and the healing of the
leper and the paralytic, and the multitude reclining on
the grass, the baskets and the remnants taken
up, and the fragments, and the transfiguration on
Mount Thabor, the Lord's crucifixion, His burial,
His resurrection, His holy ascension, and the descent
of the Holy Spirit? Who that beholds the
history of Abraham, and the knife approaching the
throat of his son, is not moved to compunction and
tears? In a word, all the sufferings of our Lord. It
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg 310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were better for you, emperor, if the choice were offered
you, to be called a heretic than the persecutor and
destroyer of the histories, the pictures, the images, the
sufferings of our Lord. Yet to be called a heretic would
be thy misery and thy loss. Let me tell you the difference.
The heretic is said to be known, when he is
known only to few. The scandals he gives are dark, the
thoughts perplexed and hard to discern. Those who
enforce them and are destitute of humiliation soon fall by
their own ignorance and confusion of mind. Their condemnation
is not so great as yours. You have openly
pursued things well observed and conspicuous as light.
You have stripped naked the churches of God. As the
holy fathers clothed and adorned them you have left them
bare and tattered. And that, too, when you had no less
a pontiff than the lord Germanus, our brother and fellow
priest. You should have taken his counsel as that of a
father and teacher, as aged and experienced in matters
both of Church and State. He is ninety-five years old:
he has served one after another patriarch and emperor.
He was never dispensed with, for his utility in both
these services. You disregarded him and called to your
side that transgressing fool the Ephesian, the son of
Apsimar, and his like. For the lord Germanus and the
then patriarch George, having informed and persuaded
Constantine, the son of Constans, the father of Justinian,
to write to us at Rome, he wrote to us under sanction of
an oath, and proposed to us fitting men that there should
be an ecumenical Council. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Nor will I,’</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">‘sit
with them as emperor, nor speak as having control, but
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page311">[pg 311]</span><a name="Pg311" id="Pg311" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as one of them; and as the pontiffs enact I will execute.
And those who hold the right we will receive, and those
who hold the wrong we will cast out and banish. If my
father perverted anything in the pure and blameless
faith, I will be the first to lay him under anathema. For
it was by the grace of God that we sent to you; and the
Sixth Council was held in peace.’</span> O emperor, you
know that the dogmas of holy church belong not to kings
but to pontiffs, and require to be infallibly determined.
For this reason pontiffs have been set over the churches,
who abstain from secular matters, and kings equally
abstain from matters of the Church and take charge of
what is in their hands. The agreement of Christ-loving
kings and of faithful pontiffs is one power when their
administration is ruled by peace and charity.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You have written in favour of an ecumenical Council
being held. To us it seems unadvisable. You are he who
prosecutes, insults and destroys the images. Give way,
and grant us silence, and the world will be at peace, and
scandals will cease. Suppose that we listen to you, that
bishops have met together from all the world, that the
Senate and Council have sat. Where is the devoted
Christian emperor who is wont by custom to sit at the
Council, to honour those who speak on the right side,
to reject those who err from the truth, when you, the
emperor, waver, and speak with the tongue of barbarians?
Know you not that your attack upon the holy images is
a work of contention, arrogance, and pride? At a
moment when the churches of God enjoyed unbroken
peace you raised up dissensions, enmities, and scandals.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a name="Pg312" id="Pg312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Be quiet, rest, and there is no need of a Council. Write
to every one and everywhere throughout the world
which you have scandalised by saying that Germanus,
patriarch of Constantinople, and Gregory, Pope
of Rome, have erred respecting the images, and we will
bear you scatheless for the sin of your mistake, as
having received from God authority to loose things in
heaven and things on earth. God is our witness that
we have presented all the letters which you have written to
us to the ears and hearts of the kings of the West,
pacifying them in respect of your soul, praising and
magnifying you in respects of your former government.
Hence they welcomed your imperial letters with the
honour due from kings when they had not yet heard of
your evil attack upon the images. When they heard
and were assured of this, that you had sent Jovinus,
your officer of the guards, to destroy the statue of our
Saviour, called the Witness, by which many miracles
have been worked, many women of fervent zeal, such as
the ointment-sellers, were present, beseeching the guardsman
not to do it. He heard them not, but planted a
a ladder, and mounted it, and with three blows of his axe
shivered the face of the Saviour. The women could not
bear that impious act. They drew away the ladder,
clubbed him, and put him to death on the spot. You,
zealous for evil, sent and slew there I know not how
many women, in the presence of competent witnesses
from Rome, from France, from the Vandals, from Mauritania,
from Gothia, and generally from all the countries
comprising the interior of the West. When these
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg 313]</span><a name="Pg313" id="Pg313" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
returned each to his own land and told the story of your
revolutionary and childish deeds, they tore down your
laurelled letters and defaced your countenance. Lombards
and Sarmatians and other peoples towards the
north overran unhappy Decapolis, they took your very
metropolis, Ravenna, deposed your magistrates, and
appointed their own. And they are minded so to do to
imperial possessions adjoining us, and to Rome, while
you are not able to defend us. These are the results of
senseless folly. Yet you frighten us and say <span class="tei tei-q">‘I will send
to Rome and break in pieces the image of St. Peter, nay,
and bring up in fetters their bishop Gregory, as Constans
did to Martin’</span>. And yet you should know and be
assured that the pontiffs who in series sit at Rome for the
sake of peace are as a middle wall and a fence
to the East and to the West, the arbitrators of
concord. And the emperors, your predecessors,
struggled hard to maintain this peace. And if you
bluster and threaten us, we have no need to fight you.
Let the Bishop of Rome retreat twenty-four stades
into Campania and go you, pursue the winds. Our
predecessor, the pontiff Martin, sat for peace-sake exhorting.
Thus it was that the evil Constans, erroneous
in his belief as to the Holy Trinity, and throwing in his
aid to the then heretical pontiffs, Sergius and Paul and
Pyrrhus, sent and kidnapped him and tyrannously
brought him up to Byzantium. After many cruelties
inflicted he banished him, as he inflicted many on Maximus
the monk also, and his disciple Anastasius, and
banished them to Lazika. And Constans, their banisher,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page314">[pg 314]</span><a name="Pg314" id="Pg314" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was murdered, and died in his sin. And the count, who
was the chief of his household, being assured by the
bishops of Sicily that he was a heretic, buried him
secretly in the church, and his course was ended in his
sin. But for the blessed Martin, the city in which he
was banished bears witness to him, Cherson, and the
Bosphorus, and all the North, and the dwellers in the
North, by flocking to his tomb and receiving cures.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“May the Lord think us worthy to go the way of
Martin, but for the help of the many we are willing to live,
and live on. For all the West has its eyes fixed upon
our humility, if we be not such, but they have a great
faith in us, and upon him whose statue you threaten to
destroy and sweep away, the blessed Peter, whom all the
kingdoms of the West look upon as a god upon earth.
And if you venture to try the truth of this, the kings of
the West are ready even to avenge the easterns whom
you have wronged. But, we beseech you in the Lord,
turn away from these revolutionary, childish actions.
You know that you are not able to defend Rome, the
very head of your royalty, unless perhaps the mere city
from its nearness to the sea and a fleet. As I said
before, if the Pope go two miles and a half out of
Rome, he fears nothing from you. One thing is our grief:
savages and barbarians are civilised; you that are
civilised become savage and barbarous. In full assurance
of faith the whole West makes its offering to the
holy Prince of the Apostles. And if you send to pull
down the statue of St. Peter, look, we tell you beforehand,
not on us be the bloodshed which will follow. On

thy neck and head let it fall. We have just received an
entreaty from the far West, from one called Septetus,
desiring by the grace of God to see our face, that we
may give him holy baptism. To avoid the reproach of
neglect and slackness we are preparing for the journey.</span>

Indeed it is a burden to my life that you have not
changed, but persist in the same evils—not having a
Christian mind, nor being a follower and imitator of our
holy and glorious wonder-working fathers and teachers.
Indeed, foreign teachers I do not bring into the field,

your self-assurance, and the passions of your own heart,
when you wrote, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I am priest as well as emperor’</span>. This
indeed, the emperors before you showed both in word
and deed by planting and caring for the churches; in
conjunction with the bishops seeking out the truth with
the desire and zeal of orthodoxy. Such were the great
Constantine, the great Theodosius, the great Valentinian,
and Constantine the father of Justinian II., the man of
the Sixth Council. Those emperors governed in the
spirit of religion, assembling councils in unity of mind and
purpose with the bishops, searching out truth of doctrine,
and so establishing and adorning the holy churches.
These are priests and emperors; they showed it by their
action. But you from the time you took the empire
have not kept to the end the boundaries set by the
Fathers. You found the churches arrayed in embroidered
robes, fringed with gold; you stripped off their ornaments
and left them in nakedness. For what are our
churches? Are they not things made with hands—stones,
wood, straw, at best? But they were adorned
by pictures and histories, portraying the wonders of
the saints, the sufferings of our Lord, and of His holy

things. That military, ill-omened, rude mind, which

you the royal robes, the purple, the diadem, the mantle,
the several marks of rank, you would seem, in the
sight of men, unseemly, shapeless, worthless; so you
have made the churches. As you would then be, you
have stripped the churches, and reduced them to
tatters. For, just as the pontiff has no authority to
enter the palace, and to make royal appointments, so
the emperor has no authority to enter into the church,
to make elections of the clergy, to consecrate and
handle the symbols of the sacred mysteries, nor even
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg 318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to participate in them without the priest. Let each of
us remain in the vocation wherein he was called by
God. O emperor, do you see the difference between
bishops and kings? If any one sins against you, O
emperor, you confiscate his house, and leave him
naked of all but his life, and, at last, you hang or behead
him, or banish him, and make him a stranger to
his children, and all his relations and friends. Pontiffs
do not this. But if any one has sinned and confessed,
instead of hanging and beheading, they put upon his
neck the gospel and the cross, they guard him in their
treasury, banish him to where the deacons and catechumens
attend, put fasting on his stomach, vigil on his
eyes, thanksgiving on his tongue. And when they
have well disciplined and chastised him, they set before
him the precious Body of the Lord, and give him to
drink His holy Blood. And having restored him to be a
vessel of election, cleansed from sin, they help him
forward, pure and blameless, to the Lord. Emperor,
do you see the difference between church and
palace? Emperors who have reigned piously in Christ
have neither disobeyed nor afflicted pontiffs. You, O
emperor, transgressor and perverter, wrote with your
own hand and subscribed, that he who removes the
boundaries of the Fathers is accursed. Therein you
condemned yourself, and separated the Holy Spirit from
you: you punish and tyrannise over us with the
soldier's arm of flesh. We, unarmed and undefended,
having no earthly and carnal armies, invoke the
sovereign ruler of all creation, Christ, whose seat is in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page319">[pg 319]</span><a name="Pg319" id="Pg319" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
heaven, who leads the hosts of the heavenly powers
that He may send to you a demon, according to the
Apostle's words, to <span class="tei tei-q">‘deliver over such a one to Satan
for the destruction of the flesh,’</span> that the spirit may be
saved. See, O emperor, into what a depth of shamelessness
and inhumanity you have thrust yourself.
You have cast your soul into abysses and precipices,
because you would not humble yourself, nor bend your
stubborn neck. For, when bishops, by good instruction
and teaching, are able to present kings to God blameless,
and exempt from errors and faults, they lay up a
store of praise and glory before Him for the great Resurrection,
when God will make manifest our hidden
deeds in the presence of His angels. We, the humble,
will then be ashamed, not to have reclaimed you
through your disobedience. The pontiffs, before us,
who each, in his own time, present their emperors to
God, shame our poverty, in that we do not, in our days,
present an emperor in honour and glory, but one disgraced
and counterfeit. Once again we invite you:
repent and be converted: enter into the truth: maintain
what you found and received: give honour and
glory to our holy and renowned fathers and teachers,
who, following God's guidance, opened the blindness of
our hearts and eyes, until they recovered sight. Your
letter said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Why was nothing said about images in the
six Councils?’</span> Most true, O emperor, neither was anything
said about bread and water, eating or not eating,
drinking or not drinking. From the very beginning
these things were given for the life of man. So, too,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span><a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were images handed down. Bishops carried them into
councils. No traveller, loving Christ and God, went
on a journey without pictures, as men of virtue, and in
God's favour. We pray you become bishop at once,
and emperor, as you wrote. If, as emperor, you are
ashamed to call yourself to account, write to all the
countries which you have scandalised, by saying that
Gregory, the Pope of Rome, has erred in the matter of
images, and also Germanus, the patriarch of Constantinople.
Then we take upon ourselves the guilt of your
sin, as those who have received from the Lord authority
and warrant to loose and to bind things on earth and
things in heaven. And we will make you without
charge as to this. You refuse. We, as those who
shall give account to Christ our Master, have exhorted,
have instructed you, as we were taught by the Lord.
You recoiled: you refused to obey us, weak as we are:
and Germanus, your bishop: and our fathers, the holy
and glorious wonder-workers and teachers. You followed
men perverse and rotten, erring from truth of
doctrine. Take your portion with them. As we wrote
to you before, we, by the grace of God, are following
the road to the interior of the West for those who seek
baptism. I have sent thither bishops and clergy of our
holy Church. Their princes have received them, and
bow their heads to be illuminated. They ask for me in
person to receive them. On this path, by God's grace,
we are bent: that we may not be condemned for neglect.</span>

These letters, which I have given entire, were written
at the end of the third decade of the eighth century.
They mark the breaking out of the Iconoclast persecution.
They seem to me to give a complete picture not
merely of the personal character in the two great factors of
the time, Pope St. Gregory II. and the Isaurian emperor,
Leo III., but of the power and influence of the Pope
and the bishops in the spiritual life, and of the eastern
ruler in the civil commonwealth. What the Pope claims,
he puts forth in the most distinct language, and through
all his letters it comes out that his predecessors have
ever both possessed and exercised it. It is matter of
simple history. Again we see incidentally from
the words which he uses regarding the images and
pictures, that, when he wrote, they were as much
part of the Church's ritual as the prayers. To
expel them from the Church was at once a complete
interference with the inner life and conduct of Christians,
and also had the effect to make at least in appearance
the sacred places themselves synagogues and mosques,
instead of habitations wherein Christ, His holy Mother
and the saints had a dwelling. The conjunction of
tyranny with impiety in Leo's attempt is made manifest.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, the relation between kings who rule the secular
commonwealth, and the Pope, who, with the bishops
throughout the world, presides over the one fold of Christ,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg 322]</span><a name="Pg322" id="Pg322" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is marked as simply and also as decisively as words can
mark it. The Pope recognises in the amplest terms
the temporal king as God's minister in his own
domain, not a mandatory appointed by the people,
who might be called to account by the people,
and be deposed at its will, but the image of
God, and one who administers the authority of God
for the government of human society. As simply
and as distinctly he mentions himself as holding, by
express grant of God, power to bind and to loose things
in earth and things in heaven. The king has no more
power to enter the Church and touch the things of God
therein than he himself has to enter the palace, and
make appointments in matters of State. But there
is this great difference—he has to answer for the
conduct of kings in spiritual matters. Kings have to
answer for how they treat him; but cannot call him to
account for his administration of the divine power committed
to him. In all things that concern sin the
spiritual supremacy is complete. Its giver is God
alone, and to God alone it is subject. This root of the
spiritual power is brought out by the whole tenor of
his words, in which the exact mediæval relation of the
two powers is implicitly contained. The supreme
minister of God in temporal things is the first son, but
likewise the subject of the Church in spiritual things.
In all this Pope Gregory II. in the year 727 may be
said exactly to repeat what Pope Gelasius said in the
year 494, both unarmed Popes speaking to emperors,
lords of armies and absolute in civil power.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page323">[pg 323]</span><a name="Pg323" id="Pg323" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The relation between East and West is also very distinctly
stated. The East lies crouching almost helpless
beneath an unalloyed despotism, whilst all the nations
of the West look up to St. Peter in Rome <span class="tei tei-q">“as a God
upon earth”</span>. When this was written just ninety years
had passed since the sepulchre of Christ had fallen
into subjection to the infidel and no less anti-Christian
Saracen. The pilgrims who could no longer go to the
sepulchre of Christ went to the sepulchre of the fisherman,
and saw in the statue of St. Peter in his own Basilica
the symbol of Christ reigning. But likewise all the kings
of the West looked upon the successor of St. Peter as no
less seated on the throne of justice, of peace, of concord, of
charity, than as the supreme oracle of the Christian faith.
What the patriarch Sophronius had said of him in the
agony of the holy city before the impure Omar, the
nations of the West knew and felt him to be. As Leo
III. threatened to destroy the statue of Peter, so they
went to him for baptism, so their kings were already
buried in peace beneath the shadow of the Vatican.
In 716, the year before the accession of Leo III.,
Theodon, Duke of Bavaria, came to Rome, being the
first German prince who made a pilgrimage to the tomb
of the apostles, as later on in 726, the very year in
which the nefarious proceedings of Leo III. began, Ina,
king of Wessex, with his queen Ethelberga came and
began the school of the English in Rome, and made his
land tributary to the Romescot.<a id="noteref_170" name="noteref_170" href="#note_170"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">170</span></span></a> So Constantine the
Bearded had acknowledged the authority which his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page324">[pg 324]</span><a name="Pg324" id="Pg324" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
successor was trying to diminish, while he sought to
reduce the Christian Church, instinct with the presence,
the miracles, the sufferings of our Lord, His Mother,
and His Saints, to the bareness of the Jewish synagogue
and the Mohammedan mosque.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be observed also that the Pope associates his
own office with that of bishops throughout the world,
especially with that of Germanus, as bishop of the
imperial city. In his mind the bishops belong to the
Pope, and the Pope no less to the bishops. There is no
jealousy of them in his supremacy, nor of him in their
subordinate jurisdiction. He censures Leo III. for not
consulting his patriarch, Germanus. The authority
which he so clearly describes is one and the same in the
whole episcopate, where St. Gregory II. himself according
to the language used three centuries before of St.
Leo the Great is <span class="tei tei-q">“princeps episcopalis coronæ”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All these things come out not in the way of controversy
but in an uncontroversial and authoritative
exhortation of a Pope to an emperor. The Pope is clad
in spiritual armour only in the midst of a captive
province; the emperor is the master of fleets and legions
behind the walls of Constantine.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No history written afterwards at a distance of time
could set forth these things with so great a force as the
words of a Pope issued to the chief actor in a desperate
struggle at the very beginning of the conflict. The immediate
result is to be noted. In the year 730 the emperor,
finding that he could not make Germanus, the nonagenarian
patriarch of Constantinople, further his design
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page325">[pg 325]</span><a name="Pg325" id="Pg325" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in stripping the churches of their ornament, deposed him
and put a compliant instrument in his stead, Anastasius,
a priest and officer of the great Church, who held the
see three and twenty years to the time of Leo's son
Kopronymus, with what effect and what ending will be
afterwards seen. St. Gregory II. died in 731. In the
four years which elapsed from the first letter to his death
he was rewarded for it by the emperor Leo in five
attempts to have him murdered. All these attempts
were frustrated by the fidelity of those about the Pope,
and by the awakened solicitude of the Italian people,
who saw in Leo the most cruel and remorseless of
tyrants, in Gregory not only the champion of their faith,
but the defender of their temporal well-being, of every
moral as well as religious liberty.<a id="noteref_171" name="noteref_171" href="#note_171"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">171</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Greek chronographer, Theophanes, the main part
of whose life belongs to this same eighth century, calls
Pope Gregory II. <span class="tei tei-q">“the most holy apostolic man, the
assessor<a id="noteref_172" name="noteref_172" href="#note_172"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">172</span></span></a> of Supreme Peter in his chair, conspicuous in
word and deed”</span>. His resistance to the rude soldier on
the eastern throne won him great praise from the subjects
of that throne. The rude soldier met him only with
scorn and violence, as he met the murmuring of
his people. Greece itself had taken arms in defence of
its violated churches. Leo, by means of the Greek fire,
destroyed the fleet of the insurgent Cyclades, and
punished with the utmost severity his opponents in the
capital. He carried on with greater violence the attack
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg 326]</span><a name="Pg326" id="Pg326" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
on the images. In many cases it passed on to the relics.
The patriarch Germanus made one more attempt to
persuade the emperor. He reminded the emperor of the
oath taken at his coronation to maintain the faith of the
Fathers. This brought matters to an open breach. St.
John of Damascus attests that <span class="tei tei-q">“the blessed Germanus,
distinguished in his life and his words, was scourged and
banished”</span>. Another Greek historian, Cedrenus, adds
that the emperor called him an idolater and struck with
his own hands the patriarch of ninety years, who laid
upon the altar of the great church the omophorion, the
symbol of his rank, and departed into exile, with the
words, <span class="tei tei-q">“If I am Jonas, cast me into the sea, but I cannot
touch the faith without a General Council be held”</span>.
Germanus had sat for fifteen years; St. John Chrysostom
and he the noblest who ever sat on that perilous throne.
He retired to his paternal house, and did not cease his
courageous struggle against the Iconoclast. He died in
most extreme old age, it is supposed in 740.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The destruction of the images proceeded with brutal
violence. Leo was not content with destroying them,
but likewise ruined the finest works of art. The new
patriarch, Anastasius, priest and syncellus of Sancta
Sophia, who had played the traitor to the man in whose
place the emperor had intruded him, acted with the
emperor in all his violence. Bishops were persecuted as
idolaters, and above all the monks, who practised painting.
The schools directed by them perished almost
entirely. Leo is even said to have burnt the famous
library with the twelve monks and their superior who
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page327">[pg 327]</span><a name="Pg327" id="Pg327" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
presided over it. The imperial edict found no execution
in the East only, under Saracenic domination, where the
great theologian, John of Damascus, openly opposed the
Iconoclasts, as the Pope had; like whom he censured the
imperial despotism in religious matters. <span class="tei tei-q">“It belongs
not to kings,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“to lay down laws for the Church.
The Apostle said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘God has placed in the Church first
apostles, then prophets, thirdly, pastors and teachers for
the perfection of the Church’</span>; he did not go on to say
kings. And, again, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Obey those set over you and be
subject to them, for they watch over you, as those who
will give account for your souls’</span>. And further,
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Remember your prelates, who have spoken the word of
God to you, whose faith follow, considering; the end of
their conversation’</span>. Not kings, but apostles and
prophets, pastors and doctors spoke the word to you.
When God had commanded David concerning building
Him a house, He said afterwards to him, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Thou shalt not
build Me a house, because thou art a man of blood’</span>. The
Apostle Paul cried out, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Tribute to whom tribute is due;
custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to
whom honour’</span>. To kings belong prosperity of the body
politic; the regimen of the Church to pastors and
teachers. This, brethren, is the invasion of a robber.
Saul rent the mantle of Samuel. What was the retribution?
God rent the kingdom from him and gave it to
David, the meekest of men. Jezabel persecuted Elias;
swine and dogs licked up her blood, and harlots washed
themselves in it. Herod slew John, and died eaten up
of worms. And now the blessed Germanus, illustrious
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page328">[pg 328]</span><a name="Pg328" id="Pg328" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in life and word, has been scourged and banished with
many other bishops and fathers, whose names we know
not. Is not this a robber's act? <span class="tei tei-q">‘The Lord, when
scribes and Pharisees drew near to tempt Him, that they
might entangle Him in His talk, and asked Him, is it
lawful to give tribute to Cæsar. He answered, bring
Me the coin: when they brought it He said, whose image
is this? They answered, Cæsar's. And He said, Give
then to Cæsar the things of Cæsar, and to God the
things of God.’</span> We yield to you, O emperor, in the
things that are secular, tribute, custom, gifts. As to
these our substance is in your hands. But in the
regimen of the Church we have pastors who have spoken
to us the word, and have formed ecclesiastical legislation;
we remove not the ancient boundaries which our fathers
have set us, but we hold to the traditions as we have
received them. For, if we begin to pull about in the
smallest thing the structure of the Church, the whole
will come to pieces bit by bit.”</span><a id="noteref_173" name="noteref_173" href="#note_173"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">173</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While Leo III. was thus violently proscribing and
executing the defenders of the Church's rights in the
East, St. Gregory II. at Rome censured his interference
with the faith, but maintained his sovereignty as emperor
in Italy. He had much ado to keep the peoples
of Italy within imperial allegiance. When Anastasius,
the intruded heretical patriarch of Constantinople, sent
the letter announcing his succession to Gregory, the
Pope rejected it. The personal acts of the emperor
against his life did not move him from his settled
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg 329]</span><a name="Pg329" id="Pg329" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
purpose. The guardsman Marinus was sent as duke to
Rome with orders to kill the Pope, or at least to take
him prisoner. He could do nothing. A second attempt
was made by the Duke Basil, in conjunction with the
chartular Jordanes and the sub-deacon John. A third
under the exarch Paul, who caused troops to march
against Rome. Romans and Tuscans encountered them
and made them retreat. Duke Basil had to save his
life by taking refuge in a monastery. The Romans
frustrated the further attempts of the exarch, and
compelled the Pope to assume the full government of
Rome, while the emperor intended to depose him and
put a compliant tool in his place. Venice, Ravenna,
and the five cities of the Pentapolis, under support of
the Lombards, chose themselves dukes, renounced
obedience to the exarch, and declared themselves for
the cause of the Pope. The purpose of the Italians was
to choose themselves a new emperor and advance upon
Constantinople. Only the fidelity and the prudence of
the Pope, who still hoped for the emperor's amendment,
prevented the execution of this project.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Lombard king, Liutprand, thought it was just the
opportunity for which he was waiting to extend his
monarchy in central Italy. Exhilaratus, imperial prefect
at Naples, with his son Adrian, got possession of part of
Campania, and set the people against the Pope; but the
Romans attacked them, and after a furious battle slew
them both. They chased the duke Peter from Rome.
In the territory of Ravenna it came to a fierce struggle
between the Italians on the Pope's side and the imperials,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page330">[pg 330]</span><a name="Pg330" id="Pg330" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in which the exarch Paul lost his life. The
Lombards took many cities, especially in the Pentapolis,
and well nigh put an end to the imperial dominion
there. King Liutprand advanced as far as Sutri, took
it, but a hundred and forty days later bestowed it upon
the Apostles Peter and Paul, that is, the Roman Church.
This was in the year 727. It is reckoned by some the
first beginning of the State of the Church.<a id="noteref_174" name="noteref_174" href="#note_174"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">174</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then it lay in the hand of the Pope to put an end to
Byzantine dominion in central Italy. The exarchate
was in Liutprand's possession. Had Gregory II. come
to terms with him, the Pope would have obtained a
free hand over the duchy of Rome. It already refused
tribute to the emperor; in arms repulsed his troops,
frustrated the repeated attempts upon the freedom and
life of Gregory II., and bound itself under oath to
protect him. The city of Rome expelled the imperial
duke, and seems to have given itself a municipal
government. It was the desire of the cities on the
Adriatic to substitute an orthodox for an heretical
emperor. Had the Pope put himself at the head of
this revolt, the emperor's power was at an end. He did
it not. He maintained the purity and the freedom of
the faith against imperial interference; but he urged
the population to continue their allegiance to the
sovereign. No stronger proof of this can be given than
a letter of the Pope to Ursus, doge of Venice, in these
words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Gregory, the bishop, servant of the servants
of God, to Ursus, duke of Venice. Since by sinful
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg 331]</span><a name="Pg331" id="Pg331" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
action the city of Ravenna, the head of all, has been
captured by that unutterable race of Lombards, and our
son, the noble lord the exarch, is, as we know, sojourning
at Venice, your nobility should support him, and maintain
his cause, as we do, that the city of Ravenna may
return to the former condition of the sacred commonwealth,
as belonging to the domain of our lords and
sons, the high emperors Leo and Constantine. So by
the help of the Lord we may be able to remain firm, by
zeal and love to our holy faith, in the commonwealth
and the imperial service. God preserve you in safety,
beloved son.”</span><a id="noteref_175" name="noteref_175" href="#note_175"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">175</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This conduct could not fail to endanger the Pope's
position with king Liutprand. In the year 728 the
strangest scene of this perplexed time took place. The
Lombard king appeared with his host before Rome.
Pope Gregory II. visited him in his camp, and exercised
such influence over him that the king desisted from the
siege, went as pilgrim to the Apostle's tomb, and left as
gifts there his crown, his arms, and his mantle.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such events as these fill up the last four years of
Gregory II. The result was what we might expect.
Lord of Rome the emperor was called; Pope Gregory
II. became in fact a glorious beginning of the papal rule.
Not reckless force, not ambitious struggle and self-seeking
formed the basis of this rule, but the free voice
of the population in return for real protection, for duty
steadfastly fulfilled, for never-failing courage, firm belief,
and holy life. Put on the one hand the struggles, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg 332]</span><a name="Pg332" id="Pg332" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fierce enmities, the treacheries, the revolts, the scenes of
blood, the shifting of parties evoked by the Iconoclast
storm in Italy and Rome, threatened by the two antagonists,
Greeks and Lombards; and on the other hand
the great activity of Pope Gregory II. in his own
spiritual domain. And then estimate the Pope who
repulsed Leo III. in his attack upon the Church's
indefeasible rights, but maintained him as emperor;
who fostered St. Boniface, enabling him by erecting a
united hierarchy to lay the foundation of a Germany,
one and Christian. We may fairly place the second
Gregory by the side of the first for prudence, for
courage, for insight, for the sagacity of a ruler in the
person of a saint. The great annalist has even said of
him, <span class="tei tei-q">“If what he wrote were extant, and what he did
had been more carefully recorded, he would be thought
no less than Gregory the Great”</span>.<a id="noteref_176" name="noteref_176" href="#note_176"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">176</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the 11th February, 731, St. Gregory II. closed a
pontificate as renowned in its present action, as fruitful
in its results. While the clergy and laity stood beside
his coffin, they chose his successor, who was consecrated
thirty-five days later, when the consent of the exarch
was brought from Ravenna, this being the last time it
was given by a viceroy of the Greek emperor.<a id="noteref_177" name="noteref_177" href="#note_177"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">177</span></span></a>

exceedingly skilful in their meaning by his long study
of them. He was a polished speaker, an exhorter to
all good works, a favourite popular preacher, a maintainer
of the Catholic and Apostolic faith immutilate,
who, by his fatherly warnings, ceased not to strengthen
the hearts of the faithful, a fearless and zealous defender
of orthodoxy: a lover of poverty, providing solicitously
for those in want, not only with piety, but
with careful pains. Redeemer of captives, generous
supporter of orphans and widows: a lover of the religious
life, so, by God's help, he reached the sacred
order of the priesthood. Upon him the Romans,
moved from the highest to the lowest by an inspiration
from heaven, while he was absorbed in devotion beside
the coffin of his predecessor, suddenly laid their hands
and chose him for pontiff. It was in the times of the
emperors Leo and Constantine, in the midst of that
persecution which they set up, for the casting down
and destruction of the sacred images of our Lord Jesus
Christ and the holy Mother of God, of the apostles,
and all saints and confessors. The same most holy
man issued writings with the vigour of the Apostolic
See, like as his predecessor of holy memory had done,
to move them to repentance, and to put away this
error.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Anastasius then records how the emperor had imprisoned
his messenger in Sicily. <span class="tei tei-q">“Whereupon the

Council at the sacred confession of St. Peter's most holy
body, with all the clergy and the people, and passed a
decree, that if henceforth there be any who, despising
those who faithfully retain the ancient usage of the
Apostolic Church, pull down, destroy, profane, or blaspheme
the veneration of the Sacred Images, that is, of
our God and Lord Jesus Christ, of His Ever-Virgin
Mother, the immaculate and glorious Mary, of the blessed
apostles, and of all saints, he be debarred from the Body
and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, that is, from the
unity and structure of the whole Church. This they all
solemnly confirmed with their subscriptions.”</span><a id="noteref_178" name="noteref_178" href="#note_178"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">178</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While the emperor replied to the Council's decree by
imprisoning the papal bearer of it for a year in Sicily,
the position of Pope Gregory III. was one of great difficulty
in respect to the Lombard duchies of Benevento
and Spoleto. They desired to be set free from their
loose connection with King Liutprand, who, on his part,
desired their complete subordination to himself. To
the Pope their maintenance was of great importance.
Thence arose a web of party-shiftings, treaties, and
counter treaties, which encompasses the whole later
history of the Lombard kingdom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The archbishop of Ravenna had taken part in the
Council at Rome, and his city was as much opposed to
the emperor's godless attempts as was Rome. Leo III.
resolved to be avenged upon the Pope and Italy. He
put a great fleet under the command of the Duke
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg 335]</span><a name="Pg335" id="Pg335" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Manes, and ordered him to sack Ravenna, to treat the
cities of the Pentapolis as rebels, to march on Rome, to
destroy the images there, to treat without mercy those
who attempted to defend them, to seize the Pope, and
bring him in fetters to Constantinople. But storms deranged
these plans. A hurricane fell upon the fleet as
it was in sight of Ravenna. Part of it was sunk with
all the crews: part managed to reach an arm of the
Po, close to the city. Manes disembarked troops from
it, and went against Ravenna. The people took arms,
with the bishop at their head: whilst the women and
old men went in sackcloth and ashes through the
streets in supplication; the young marched out against
the enemy, and drew him into an ambuscade. The
Greeks flew to their ships, many of which were sunk,
and the 26th June, 733, was kept as a perpetual festival
in Ravenna: while, for six years out of hatred to
the Greeks the conquerors would eat no fish from that
arm of the river.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Leo became furious at this reverse: he redoubled
his cruelty on the defenders of images, and since he
could hurt the Roman Church in no other way, he confiscated
all the possessions of the Church in his realm.
In the words of Theophanes,<a id="noteref_179" name="noteref_179" href="#note_179"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">179</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“That opponent of God,
roused to a greater madness, and indulging further in
his Arabian mind, imposed capitation taxes on the third
part of Calabria and Sicily. Moreover, he ordered to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page336">[pg 336]</span><a name="Pg336" id="Pg336" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be paid to the public treasury the so-named patrimonies
of the holy chief apostles honoured at Rome, three
golden talents and a-half, which had been paid of old
to the churches, and he subjected to inspection and enrolment
the male children, as Pharaoh did of old to the
Hebrews: what not even his teachers, the Arabs, had
done to the Christians in the East.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But he did a great deal more and a worse thing not
noted by Theophanes. By an arbitrary act of secular
despotism he severed from the jurisdiction of the Roman
patriarch not only Calabria and Sicily, but the ten
Illyrian provinces, Epirus, Illyricum, Macedonia, Thessaly,
Achaia—that is present Greece—Dacia, Mæsia,
Dardania, Prævalis, and attached them to the patriarchate
of Constantinople. By this act its jurisdiction became
co-extensive with the eastern empire, and the patriarch
ecumenical in that sense of the Greek word which considered
their own empire as pre-eminently the world, the
land that is inhabited by men, as contra-distinguished
from the land foraged by barbarians.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The patriarch to whom this honour accrued was that
Anastasius who had been put by force into the place of
the deposed Germanus, and was afterwards scourged
and deposed by the same force under Leo's son and
successor, Kopronymus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Calabria and Sicily returned to the jurisdiction of the
Pope as patriarch when the eastern emperor lost his
dominion in them. The other provinces remained under
the jurisdiction of Constantinople, the gift of an heretical
emperor to a patriarch raised by him as his instrument
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg 337]</span><a name="Pg337" id="Pg337" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the ecumenical throne and at last deposed by his son
as an instrument of little value.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this act we see the completion of the aggression
begun in the year 381, which attempted to give to the
see of Constantinople the second rank in the Church.
The sees of Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem have
sunk under it, but they have fallen into Saracen
domination, and are little more than names; the
diminished empire has in its capital the only real
patriarch, and seeks to indemnify him for eastern losses
by severing ten provinces from the patriarchal jurisdiction
of Rome, under which they had been from the beginning
of the Christian hierarchy. And Nova Roma, halved it
is true in its secular extension, and trembling at the perpetual
aggression of the Mohammedan chalif, beholds at
length its patriarch standing over against the elder
Rome as the chief instrument of imperial despotism in
spiritual things.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Leo III. consciously completes the structure which
Theodosius unwittingly began. The exaltation of the
see of the capital is from beginning to end the work of
imperial power, and this special character bears out to
the full the denunciation of it by St. Gregory the Great
in his own time, when he called the bishop's assumed
title <span class="tei tei-q">“a name of blasphemy and diabolical pride, and a
forerunner of anti-Christ”</span>.<a id="noteref_180" name="noteref_180" href="#note_180"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">180</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Further, the acts of Leo III. in 733 are unanimously
viewed by historians as having a large effect in the
deliverance of Italy from the eastern sovereignty, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg 338]</span><a name="Pg338" id="Pg338" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his arrogation of the power to sever from the Pope,
patriarch, a large extent of provinces is viewed no less
as a prelude to the great schism between the East and
West. The remaining years of Gregory III. are filled
up with his embarrassing position between the Lombard
duchies of Benevento and Spoleto and Liutprand aiming
at uniting Italy in a Lombard monarchy, whereby the
Pope should become his subject as before he had been a
subject of the Goths. From the moment when king
Liutprand resumed more decidedly his plan against the
Greek possessions and therefore against the duchy of
Rome, he was bound to endeavour to end the independence
of the two outlying Lombard duchies. But at the
same time the alliance between these duchies and the
papacy became a political necessity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the year 738 Liutprand took the field. He began
with incursions into the territory of Ravenna, and
invited the dukes of Spoleto and Benevento to attack
the duchy of Rome. They refused, since, as Pope
Gregory III. in one of his letters informs us, they had
declared that they would not take the field against God's
holy Church and her people, with whom they had entered
into covenant. Thereupon the king made war against
his disobedient liegemen. While he laid waste the
possessions of the Church in the territory of Ravenna, he
sat down before Spoleto in the spring of 739 with a considerable
force. Duke Thrasimund could not resist and
fled to Rome. In June the king entered Spoleto. He
compelled Benevento to receive his nephew Gregory for
duke. At the same time he drew the exarch to his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg 339]</span><a name="Pg339" id="Pg339" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
interest, to whom the Pope's independence had long been
odious. The confused accounts of annalists and historians
make it difficult, if not impossible, to establish particular
events in chronological accuracy. And the greatest uncertainty
lies upon one of these events which is of
particular importance, since it would secure for us an
adequate reason for the Pope's conduct. Liutprand is
said immediately after the taking of Spoleto to have
appeared before Rome, demanding that the fugitive
duke should be delivered up to him. Encamped in the
meadows of Nero, beside the Vatican, he plundered St.
Peter's, laid waste the neighbourhood, and made many
Romans prisoners. It is certain that he took four cities
in the Tuscan part of the Roman duchy, Amelia, Ortes,
Bomarzo, and Bleda, as hostages for Duke Thrasimund.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Pope was in the utmost danger of being speedily
swallowed up by the encircling Lombard monarchy.
Another siege of Rome, perhaps its capture, was to be
immediately expected. The Lombard duchies were
unable to repulse the Lombard king: for defence the
emperor was impotent. He could send a fleet to ravage
the imperial metropolis of Italy; he could not defend
the ancient mistress and maker of his empire: from
whom he still took a title, which seemed a mockery.
The Lombard threatened to dethrone Leo and make the
Pope his subject. The dread of sacrificing the Church's
independence drove St. Gregory III. to the last and sole
remaining refuge.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The relations<a id="noteref_181" name="noteref_181" href="#note_181"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">181</span></span></a>
of the Franks to Rome had been
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg 340]</span><a name="Pg340" id="Pg340" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
various since the emperor Maximian had received the
Salian Franks into the number of Rome's allies. After
the victory over Syagrius, near Soissons, Clovis had
raised up the Gallic-Frankish kingdom upon the ruins
of Roman and Visigoth dominion. When baptised by
St. Remigius, Clovis had become the first Catholic king
in the midst of northern peoples attached to Arianism.
This had brought him into manifold connection with
the Holy See. In the time of Pope Gregory II., the
conversion to the faith of Germany, from the Rhine as
far as Saxony and Thuringia, not only relied for support,
but had its root in the Frankish kingdom, and
bound it still closer with the Papacy. There were also
connections of another sort. As far back as the year
577, the emperor Justin II., conscious of his own
impotence, had given to the messenger from Rome,
soliciting help against Lombard aggression, for answer,
either to seek to gain one of the Lombard dukes, or, if
that failed, to draw the Franks to make a diversion by
an expedition into Italy. The emperor Mauritius had
himself made use of these means. From the year 584,
king Childebert had been induced, by Byzantine invitation
and gold, to undertake four campaigns against the
Lombards. But it was reserved to a stronger family
than his to co-operate in producing a great change
south of the Alps. At the head of a people formed by
the conjunction of various races amalgamated out of
Germans, Gauls, and Romans, there grew up, in spite
of sundry partial divisions, the mass of a mighty
monarchy, north of the Alps. The weakness of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg 341]</span><a name="Pg341" id="Pg341" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
larger number of the kings who succeeded Clovis
caused the chief officers of the crown to increase in
strength. The lower the Merovingians sank, the higher
rose the sons of Pipin, from the banks of the Meuse,
until they equalled and outgrew the effete race. By
the end of the first quarter of the eighth century,
Charles Martell, Major Domus, first of the Austrasian,
and then of the Neustrian-Frankish realm, had all
power in his hands. In October, 732, he had won a
greater merit from all the West than, perhaps, even
Aetius and the Visigoth kings had gained. They had
repulsed the vast Mongol mass at Chalons: he, by
Tours, in a bloody battle, had set bounds for ever to
the advance of the Arabians, overflooding Gaul after
the conquest of Spain. He threw them back upon
the uttermost south of Gaul, from which, after many
a battle, they were forced to recross the Pyrenees.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To Charles Martell, shining in the lustre of that great
victory which saved the West from Mohammed, as Leo
III. prevented his entrance into Constantinople, the
beleagured Pope turned from the cruel yet impotent
tyranny of Leo, and the pretension of the encroaching
Lombard. And his own words, at the moment of trial,
will better express his situation than any others which
can be put in his mouth:—<a id="noteref_182" name="noteref_182" href="#note_182"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">182</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-q">“We have thought it necessary to write again to
your Excellency for the excessive grief which is in our
heart, and for our tears, confiding that you are a loving

and that from reverence to him you will listen to our
charge for the defence of God's Church, and his own
peculiar people: we, who can no longer endure the
persecution and oppression of the Lombard race. They
have taken from us all the lights in St. Peter's Church,
which were given by your relations or yourself. Next
to God, we take refuge in you: for this the Lombards
oppress and make a mock of us. St. Peter's Church is
stripped, and reduced to utter desolation. But we
have rather confided the details of our sorrows to your
liegeman, the bearer of this, which he may present by
word of mouth. O my son, may the Prince of the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Either with this letter, or before it, the Pope had
sent to Charles Martell the keys of St. Peter's Confession,
together with rich presents. His messengers were
received with great honour, but no actual help in
soldiers came. It is supposed that Charles Martell was
then engaged, together with Eudo, Duke of Aquitania,
in expelling the Saracens from Southern France.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The acts of Leo III., as an open enemy of the Pope's
spiritual power, by his completion of the Byzantine
patriarch's usurped jurisdiction in the year 733, as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg 343]</span><a name="Pg343" id="Pg343" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
above described, thus precede, by about five years, the
appeal made to Charles Martell, by Gregory III., in the
face of the advancing Lombard king, Liutprand, on the
one hand, and the absence of any protection by the
emperor on the other.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such was the uncertain position of things when, in
the year 741, the three great actors were withdrawn
from this life, Leo III., on the 18th June, Charles
Martell, on the 24th October, Gregory III., on the 27th
November.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of what this most noble Pope did for Rome, Anastasius
gives a long account. If the Romans loved and admired
him as a cardinal priest, they loved and admired
him no less as Pontiff to the end. While fully acknowledging
still the sovereignty of the eastern emperor, a
man as unworthy of the loyalty which bound the Pope
to him, as a sovereign could be, the Pope neither by
his heresy nor by his tyranny was induced to renounce
him. He did, indeed, one great and momentous act.
He sent to Charles Martell the keys of St. Peter's Confession,
conjuring him in the name and person of the
Apostle, to save his city from the Lombard robber:
the city which its sovereign was neither able nor willing
to save: the city on which the robber was descending
with the utmost force. It is supposed that Charles
Martell was engaged in battle with the Saracens in
Southern France at the time. The Pope sent a second
time, to the great leader, the Hammer of the infidel,
the Liberator of the Christian. What took place is not
exactly known: but the Lombard king, Liutprand, retired
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page344">[pg 344]</span><a name="Pg344" id="Pg344" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the month of August, 739, from the siege of
Rome with his army to Pavia, and helped Charles
Martell against the Saracens, who had again invaded
Provence. Then also Rome was saved by her pontiff
from becoming a Lombard prey.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Once more towards the end of 741, Liutprand was
preparing a new expedition against Rome and its
duchy, when Rome lost, on the 27th November, St.
Gregory III., its pontiff, prince, and champion. At
Constantinople, Leo III. had been succeeded by his
son, Kopronymus, whom the Greek Zonaras calls, <span class="tei tei-q">“a
cub more cruel than his sire”</span>. Rome seemed covered
by a terrible tempest: France had been deprived not a
month before of Charles Martell. All minds were in
fearful expectation, when a star of peace appeared on
the horizon. There rose up one who, by the force of
his mind and the unsparing risk of his own person, was
to preserve Italy during ten years from the destruction
which seemed impending.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Upon the death of Pope Gregory III., the Roman
chair was filled in four days. The usual three days
having been devoted to the solemn funeral of that
Pope, the electors, on the fourth day, which was Sunday,
the 2nd December, met in the Lateran palace, and
immediately united their votes on the person of Zacharias,
and he was consecrated the same day. Two
things combined to bring about this rapid election and
ordination, one the extraordinary merit of the elected,
the other the extreme urgency of the public need, as
Rome, with its provinces, was threatened by King
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg 345]</span><a name="Pg345" id="Pg345" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Liutprand. The confirmation by the exarch, that
token of imperial oppression, was not waited for.
Zacharias was the last of those illustrious orientals of
whom a series at this time occupied the Roman Chair.
Though born in Italy, being a native of the Calabrian
city, St. Severina, he was Greek by lineage. Of him
and of his predecessor, Photius himself, the leader of
the Greek schism, has left written, <span class="tei tei-q">“How could I pass
over in silence the two Roman prelates, Gregory and
Zacharias, who were eminent for their virtue, who contributed
to increase the flock of Christ by their teaching
full of divine wisdom, who were even conspicuous by
the divine gift of miracles?”</span> Of Zacharias, the character
given by Anastasius is, <span class="tei tei-q">“a man most meek and
gentle, adorned with every goodness, a lover of the
clergy and all the Roman people, slow to anger and
quick to mercy, rendering to no man evil for evil, nor
punishing according to desert, but from the time of his
ordination made kind and tender to all: so that he
returned good for evil to his former persecutors, both
promoting and enriching them”</span>. During ten years,
Zacharias, by his wisdom and personal influence, kept
at bay the three Lombard kings, Liutprand, Rachis,
and Aistulf, who seemed on the point of completing
the long-fostered ambition of their people by the absorption
of Rome into a barbarian kingdom. The
whole time is a contest of mind against matter, of right
against encroachment. We learn, by the very words of
these Popes, that even in the eighth century the radical
opposition between Romans and Lombards continued
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg 346]</span><a name="Pg346" id="Pg346" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
still as in the time of the first invasion under
Alboin. The end of the Lombards was to make themselves
lords of all Italy: that of the Romans, to prevent
themselves passing under a barbarian yoke. True
peace there could never be between them. A truce,
liable at any time to be broken, was all that could
subsist.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Three times at least in the ten years of his pontificate,
Zacharias repeated, with Lombard kings, the
action of his great predecessor, Leo, with Attila.
Liutprand, after thirty years of reign, was consolidating
his kingdom by the reduction of the two Lombard
dukedoms, Spoleto and Benevento. Bent upon gaining
Rome, when he had subdued Spoleto, free from the
check of Charles Martell, secure of the East by the contested
succession to Leo of his son, Kopronymus, Liutprand
was at Terni. Thither Pope Zacharias resolved
to go in person, accompanied by a train of clergy.
Liutprand received the Pope with great honour, and
the result of a long interview was that he agreed to
restore to the Pope four cities of the Roman duchy
which he had taken. He likewise gave back the patrimony
of Sabina, which he had seized thirty years
before, and made peace with the Roman duchy for
twenty years. The Pope returned as it were in
triumph to Rome, was received with exultation, and
ordered a procession of thanksgiving from the Church
of St. Mary of the Martyrs, that is, the Pantheon, to
St. Peter's. This was in his first year, 742.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the next year, 743, Liutprand broke out against
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg 347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the exarchate: and Eutychius, the exarch, with the
archbishop of Ravenna, and the other cities of Emilia
and the Pentapolis, had no better resource than to
beseech the Pope to succour them. The Pope, accepting
the request, sent two legates to the king with gifts,
beseeching him to cease hostility with the Ravennese.
But they accomplished nothing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then the Pope left Rome to the government of the
Duke Stephen, and, with his train of clergy, went in
person to Ravenna. The archbishop met him fifty
miles from the city. The people welcomed him with
cries, <span class="tei tei-q">“to the shepherd who left his own sheep to deliver
us who were about to perish”</span>. But the Pope
insisted upon going on to Pavia itself, in spite of the
objections of king Liutprand to receive him. Disregarding
every risk, he reached the Po on the 28th
June, where he met the Lombard nobles sent to attend
him; and, on the 20th, he celebrated Mass on the feast
of the chief Apostle in the church of St. Peter, called
the Golden Ceiling, wherein was the shrine of St.
Augustine: whose body Liutprand himself had brought
from Sardinia.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
King Liutprand then received the Pope with great
honour in his palace. The Pope pressed him not to
attack the province of Ravenna, but to restore its
cities. The king, after great resistance, consented to
leave the province of Ravenna as it was before. The
king then accompanied the Pope to the river, and sent
his chief captains with him on his return, who restored
the territories of Ravenna, and the castle of Cesena.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg 348]</span><a name="Pg348" id="Pg348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So the Pope disarmed a second time the most powerful
of the Lombard kings, and saved the exarchate for
the empire. From that time Liutprand lived in peace
with the Romans and the Ravennese. He did not live
to receive the report of the ambassadors whom he had
sent to Constantinople to inform the emperor of the
peace thus given to Ravenna. He closed in the next
year, 744, his reign of thirty-two years, the longest in
the Lombard series, and that in which the Lombard
kingdom most developed its power. It must be confessed
that the power of religion was great over the
mind of Liutprand. He reverenced Pope Gregory
II. under the walls of Rome: he listened to the voice
of Pope Zacharias in the interviews of Terni and Pavia.
At the bidding of the Vicar of Christ, he more than
once stopped himself in the middle of his victories, and
renounced the greatest desire of his heart.
</p>

Hildebrand, Liutprand's co-regent, and successor,
maintained himself only a few months, and had to
resign the crown before the end of the year 744 to
Rachis, duke of Friuli. A good understanding seemed
to be established with the Pope under a king renowned
for piety, married to a Roman, who made rich offerings
to the Church. Peace was assured with the Roman
duchy. But after a few years Rachis also was in conflict
with the exarchate. In 749 a new war burst out in
central Italy. The king of the Lombards came in great
wrath and with a valiant army to besiege Perugia.
Then once more Pope Zacharias appeared. Attended
by some clergy and chief people of Rome he went to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg 349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
camp at Perugia. His gifts and his prayers so prevailed
with King Rachis that he consented to raise the siege of
the city and return in peace to Pavia. But the king had
been so moved by the words of Pope Zacharias that
after a few days he resigned his kingdom. With his
queen Tassia and his daughter Ratruda he came like a
pilgrim to Rome to venerate the tomb of St. Peter and
to ask admission among the clergy. The Pope cut off
the long hair of the Lombard king, gave him with his
own hands the clerical tonsure, and vested him, as well
as his wife and daughter, in the habit of St. Benedict.
He retired, by the Pope's suggestion, to Monte Cassino,
which had been restored by the abbot Petronax from its
ruin towards the end of the sixth century. With him
also retired the prince Carloman, younger brother of
King Pipin, and a Benedictine as well as Rachis. Pope
Zacharias greatly loved that monastery, enriched it with
gifts and books, and exempted it from all episcopal
jurisdiction, subjecting it immediately to the Holy See.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The three pacific victories gained by Pope Zacharias,
twice over King Liutprand and once over King Rachis,
victories due to the dignity of the Vicar of Christ and his
Christian virtues, had raised to the highest point the estimation
of the Romans for the Holy See. Is it possible to
conceive a greater contrast that that presented by Leo III.
and his son Kopronymus on the one hand, and the three
pontiffs, the second and third Gregories and Zacharias,
on the other; or between the governments of the blinding,
scourging, maiming, and torturing sovereigns of the
East, and the pastors ruling with beneficence and risking
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page350">[pg 350]</span><a name="Pg350" id="Pg350" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their lives for their flock in the West? Thus had the
Popes become the protectors of desolated Italy; therefore
had the Kings Liutprand and Rachis offered their
royal mantles at the shrine of St. Peter. We are come
now to the last and crowning incidents of this contrast.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the resignation of Rachis the true Lombard spirit
had raised his brother Aistulf to the throne. In June,
749, he was elected at Milan. Almost immediately
thereupon a series of regulations showed that other
political principles than those of Rachis had obtained the
mastery. The presents made by the last king after his
abdication were declared invalid; commerce with the
Romans forbidden. The fortresses in the Alpine passes
were strengthened. The army was put on a new footing.
Presently Aistulf marched upon the exarchate.
In July, 751, he was in Ravenna. Every imperial
possession in the northern and midland Adriatic provinces
fell into his power. Only Rome then was wanting to
Aistulf's ambition. Hitherto no barbarian had been able
to fix his seat there. His dreams were to reach all the
power of the ancient emperors in Italy, and so verify the
proud title of <span class="tei tei-q">“king of all Italy”</span> which a hundred and
fifty years before Agilulf had inscribed upon his crown.
He named his palace at Pavia <span class="tei tei-q">“the palace of Italy,”</span> and
an inscription has been found, <span class="tei tei-q">“Aistulf, in the name of
Christ, by God's will Imperator Augustus, in the fourth
year of his reign”</span>.<a id="noteref_183" name="noteref_183" href="#note_183"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">183</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No help came from Byzantium, where the emperor
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Constantine Kopronymus, after putting down a pretender
to his throne, was only occupied with Iconoclast troubles.
For a long time no opposition was perceived; when the
last exarch fell into the Lombard king's power Rome
seemed to be the sure prey of him who had won
Ravenna.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At that moment when the last authority of the
empire threatened to disappear a new bond was knitted
between Rome and the West as token of the world's
changed situation. Pipin, son of Charles Martell, on
the point of taking the idle sceptre from the hand of the
last phantom-king of Merovingian race, turned to Pope
Zacharias with the request that he would approve this
great change. This is one principal mark of the
immense moral power wielded by the Pope in the middle
of the eighth century that the mayor of the palace in
the Frankish empire sought his sanction to change his
deputed into immediate royal authority. The Pope thus
called upon exercised his supreme judgment in this
highest secular matter. He decided that it was lawful
for him who fulfilled the royal duty to be king rather
than for him who only bore the name. In these words he
deposed the Merovingian and recognised the Carlovingian
dynasty, and the nobles of the Franks assembled in diet
accepted his judgment. Pipin was proclaimed king of
the Franks in 752 on the field of Mars at Soissons.
Some but not all accounts say that St. Boniface, at the
head of the German episcopate, three years before his
martyrdom, gave the Church's sanction to the political
act, in accordance with the judgment of the Pope.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This momentous judgment of Pope Zacharias, given
at the end of 751, was one of his last acts. He died
on the 14th March, 752. The last words of Anastasius
respecting him are an epitome of his life and character.
Having recorded his general deeds of kindness and
munificence, he adds:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Embracing and fostering all
as a father and good shepherd, and absolutely allowing
none to suffer tribulation in his times, the people entrusted
to him by God lived in great security”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At once clergy and people proceeded to a new choice,
but the Stephen whom they chose lived but three days,
and died before consecration. <span class="tei tei-q">“Then,”</span> says Anastasius,
<span class="tei tei-q">“the whole people of God met in the basilica of St.
Mary at the Crib, and beseeching the mercy of our Lord
God, and with the good will of our Lady, the holy
ever-virgin Mary, Mother of God, they elected, with
one mind, another Stephen, a man preserving the tradition
of the Church with inviolable constancy, swift to
help the poor, a firm preacher, a most valiant defender
of the fold in the strength of God.”</span> Immediately a
great persecution against the city of Rome and its adjoining
cities broke out from the savage king Aistulf.
Three months after his consecration, the Pope sent two
legates, his brother, Paul, and another, with large gifts
to move the Lombard king to a treaty of peace. The
king made a peace for forty years, but in four months,
treading oath and treaty under foot, he pretended that
the city of Rome, with all its province, was subject to
him, and that all the inhabitants should pay him yearly
a capitation tax of a gold solidus. The Pope sent to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg 353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
him two fresh legates, whom the king received, but refused
all conditions, and ordered them to return to their
monasteries without seeing the Pope.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the end of this year, an imperial legate came to
Rome with two <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sacred</span></em> letters<a id="noteref_184" name="noteref_184" href="#note_184"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">184</span></span></a> from the emperor, one
for the Pope, the other for Aistulf. In it he asked
the Lombard king to restore the lands of the Commonwealth,
unjustly taken by him. The Pope immediately
sent on his brother, Paul, with the imperial Silentiarius,
to Aistulf at Ravenna. The king scorned to listen
either to emperor or Pope, but he added a messenger
of his own, to go to Constantinople, and make some
proposition to the emperor. The two legates, John
the Silentiarius, and Paul, the deacon, returned to
Rome, and reported to the Pope that they could do
nothing. Then the Pope, convinced of the evil purpose
of the king, sent to the imperial city his own messengers,
in company with John the Silentiarius, <span class="tei tei-q">“beseeching
the imperial clemency that, as he had already often
written to him, he would come with an army to defend
by every means all this part of Italy, and would deliver
this city of Rome and the whole Italian province from
the fangs of the son of iniquity”</span>.<a id="noteref_185" name="noteref_185" href="#note_185"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">185</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the meantime, <span class="tei tei-q">“that most atrocious king of the
Lombards burst into fury, threatening that he would
slay all the Romans with one sword if they did not
submit to his sovereignty”</span>. The Holy Father called
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg 354]</span><a name="Pg354" id="Pg354" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
all the Roman people together, and walked in procession
with them with naked feet, hearing in his arms the
image of our Lord still venerated in the chapel <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sancta
sanctorum</span></span>. This he carried from the Lateran Church
to Santa Maria Maggiore, the clergy and people chanting
litanies and intercessions; and Aistulf's broken
treaty of peace was affixed to a lofty cross, and formed
part of the procession.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This legation from Pope Stephen II. took place in
the year 753. The emperor Constantino Kopronymus
was not the man to save Italy from the Lombards. To
the repeated requests of the Pope he sent no other
help than imperial letters, charging him to induce
Aistulf to restore the provinces he had taken from the
empire, and to Aistulf in the same sense, calling him to
undo his diabolical aggression.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The emperor also left the Pope free to unite himself
with any one who could defend him. It was a natural
right in such a case: but the imperial sanction made it
more easy of success.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Then,”</span> says Anastasius,<a id="noteref_186" name="noteref_186" href="#note_186"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">186</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“the most holy man
having, in vain, sought, by innumerable presents, to
conciliate that pestilent king for the flocks committed
to him by God, that is, for the whole army at Ravenna
and all the people of that province of Italy, of which he
was in possession, and seeing especially that there was
no help from the imperial power, as his predecessors of
blessed memory, the second and third Gregories and
Zacharias, begged help from the king of the Franks
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg 355]</span><a name="Pg355" id="Pg355" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
against the oppressions and invasions which they had
suffered in this Roman province from the abominable
Lombard race; so he in like manner, by the inspiration
of divine grace, sent in his deep sorrow a letter by a
foreign hand to Pipin, king of the Franks.”</span> Thus from
726, the beginning of the Iconoclastic heresy and
tyranny of the emperors Leo III. and Kopronymus, the
Popes acknowledged the Byzantine sovereignty until in
753 the direct attack of the Lombard king Aistulf upon
Rome, and the attempt to make himself sovereign of the
Popes of Rome and of the territory called its duchy,
together with the impotence of the Byzantine emperor
to defend his own subjects, and the Pope himself vainly
entreating succour from him, compelled Stephen II. <span class="tei tei-q">“to
turn his thoughts from the East to the West”</span>.<a id="noteref_187" name="noteref_187" href="#note_187"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">187</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While the Lombards were pressing Rome and all its
fortified places, Pipin replied to Stephen's entreaty for
succour by sending the Bishop of Metz and the Duke
Autchar to accompany him in his journey to France.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Then the same most blessed Pope, trusting in the
mercy of our almighty God, went out of this city of Rome
to St. Peter's on the 14th October, and many Romans
followed him and people of the neighbouring cities, and
weeping and crying, they would hardly let him go on.
But he, trusting in the strength of God and the protection
of the holy Mother of God and the chief apostles
for the safety of all, weak as he was in body, began that
laborious journey, commending all the Lord's flock to
Peter, our Lord, the good shepherd and blessed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg 356]</span><a name="Pg356" id="Pg356" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Prince of the Apostles.”</span> As he drew near to Pavia that
most wicked king Aistulf sent him messengers, ordering
that he should on no account ask for the restoration of
Ravenna and its exarchate or the other places of the
commonwealth which Aistulf or his predecessors had
invaded. The Pope replied that nothing should induce
him not to ask it. When he reached Pavia and was
received by the king he made him many presents, and
ceased not with many tears to ask him for the restitution
of what he had taken. He could obtain nothing. The
Frank legates pressed that he might be allowed to go on
to France. The king asked the Pope if he desired it.
The Pope avowed it, and the king gnashed his teeth,
and sent his satellites repeatedly in secret to turn him
from it. The Frank legates at last succeeded in obtaining
permission for him to go forward.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the 15th November, attended by the bishop of
Ostia and a large train of clergy, he left Pavia, and continued
his journey. He reached the valley of the Rhone
by Aosta and the Mons Jovis, where about two hundred
years later Bernard of Menthon founded the monastery
which has given its new name to the mountain, and he
rested at length at the abbey of St. Maurice, now one of
the oldest existing monasteries.<a id="noteref_188" name="noteref_188" href="#note_188"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">188</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Stephen II. was the first Pope who crossed the Alps.
The few Popes who had up to that time travelled outside
Italy had been banished, as St. Clement by Trajan to
the Crimea, or St. Liberius confined by Constantius I.
at Berea in Thrace, or St. Silverius banished by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg 357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Belisarius to Patara; St. John I., St. Agapetus, and
Vigilius had by royal orders gone to Constantinople. St.
Martin had been taken thither a prisoner by Constans
II., and Pope Constantine, ordered by Justinian II.
to go thither, had been courteously received by
him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now at the call of duty, but with his own free consent,
Stephen II. crossed the Alps and took refuge in France,
to consolidate an alliance with the most potent kingdom
of the West, full of importance for that Christendom
which the see of St. Peter, and that alone, was creating.
As the eastern emperor had nothing for him but to
impose heresy and execute tyranny, the king of the
Franks, hearing news of his approach, sent a splendid
train under his eldest son Charles to convoy him. That
was a memorable day when Stephen and Pipin met at
the royal villa of Pontigny, near Chalons, on the Marne,
not far from the field of battle where Attila three
hundred years before failed to make Europe a Mongol
empire. Now the union of Stephen and Pipin saved it
from a Mohammedan enthralment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The long-suffering loyalty of so many Popes was at
length exhausted. The deliverance of the Holy See and
their flock from the intolerable Lombard yoke, a usurpation
both upon their natural right and their divine commission
to rule the people of God, combined with their
desertion by the eastern emperor, whom, in despite of
the most inhuman government during two hundred
years ever practised by men called Christian, they had
acknowledged and maintained, led Stephen II. to inaugurate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg 358]</span><a name="Pg358" id="Pg358" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a new political order of things. His request,
accompanied with many tears, to Aistulf at Pavia to
restore to <span class="tei tei-q">“the commonwealth”</span> of the empire the
exarchate and to forbear grasping Rome, a request which
the Lombard cast away in scorn, led the Pope, feeble as
he was, to risk all the dangers of the Alpine passes, as
well as to seek in France, where alone it could be found,
an arm strong enough to save Italy both from Lombard
and from Byzantine.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The king of the Franks, besides his eldest son Charles,
had sent Fulrad the abbot and Rothard the duke to
conduct the Pope from the monastery of St. Maurice,
whom they brought with all his retinue to the king with
great honour. <span class="tei tei-q">“When,”</span> says Anastasius, <span class="tei tei-q">“the king heard
of the most blessed pontiff's approach he hastened to
meet him with his wife, his sons, and his chief men.
Advancing three miles from his palace called Pontigny,
he dismounted from his horse, and with great humility
threw himself on the earth, together with his wife, his
children, and his chieftains, and so received the Pope.
He also walked for some space to a certain spot guiding
the Pope's horse.”</span> Then the papal train went on
together with the king to the palace, rendering thanks
to God in hymns and spiritual songs. It was the feast
of the Epiphany, and Pope and king sat side by side in
the oratory, when the Pope with tears besought the same
most Christian king that by a treaty of peace he would
arrange the cause of St. Peter and the commonwealth of
the Romans. And the king satisfied the Pope by oath
that he would to the utmost listen to all his requirements
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg 359]</span><a name="Pg359" id="Pg359" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and restore the exarchate of Ravenna and the other
rights and territories of the commonwealth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It being winter, he then caused the Pope with all
his retinue to take up his abode in the abbey of St.
Denys, near Paris. King Pipin, going to Quiersy and
there assembling all the nobles of his royal power,
inflamed them with the words of so great a father, and
ordained with them to fulfil what, under favour of Christ,
he had decreed with the most blessed Pope.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By this solemn compact between the Frank realm
and the Holy See, the king bound himself, should he be
victorious, to give over to St. Peter, and in him to Pope
Stephen, and his successors, all the places of the exarchate,
and of those lands which had belonged to the empire,
of which the Lombards had taken possession. If
we are to follow the text of the contemporaneous statements
and later references, Pipin considered this act
not as a donation, but a restitution. Those for whom
this restitution ensued were so blended together in the
view which results from Pipin's subsequent declarations
that to separate them seems impossible.<a id="noteref_189" name="noteref_189" href="#note_189"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">189</span></span></a> The one
party is the Roman Commonwealth, which here takes
the place of the empire, without, in its essence, containing
any other idea, for empire is but one form of commonwealth;
the other party is the Roman Church.
There is no reference here to the duchy of Rome, the
territory belonging to the city according to the Byzantine
departmental administration. The Pope conferred
on the king the title of Roman Patricius, a title which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page360">[pg 360]</span><a name="Pg360" id="Pg360" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Pipin accepted simply in its true meaning, understanding
by it protection of the Church, as he afterwards
named himself merely Defensor or Protector of the
Church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Stephen, in the meantime, was staying at the Abbey
of St. Denys, near Paris, for a long time dangerously ill,
in consequence of his sufferings during his journey, and
also of his great anxiety. On the 28th July, 754, he
anointed in this abbey Church, afterwards the resting-place
of the kings of France, Pipin and his wife,
Bertrada, with their sons, Charles and Carloman. So, for
the first time, the hand of a Pope touched the youthful
head of that Charles, who, in riper age, was destined to
act with such force on the fortunes of the western
Church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the negotiations between the king of the
Franks and Aistulf led to no result, the Frank army
began its march. The Lombards were defeated near
Susa, at the foot of Mont Cenis, and presently Pipin
stood before Pavia. Thereupon Aistulf consented to
peace. He promised to surrender Ravenna, and divers
other cities: he bound himself no longer to oppress
Rome and her territory. But scarcely was the covenant
made, and the Frank host withdrawn, and the Pope returned
to Rome, which he entered before the conclusion,
having been welcomed in the meadows of Nero by the
exulting people, when king Aistulf repented of his concessions.
Not only did he not give up a palm of land
in the exarchate: he broke again into the Roman
territory, took cities, laid waste the country. In this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name="Pg361" id="Pg361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
distress wore away the year 755. With New Year's
Day, 756, the king began the siege of Rome. He shut
in the city on three sides. On the height of the Janiculum
the Tuscans were encamped. Aistulf, with his
main force, lay beside the Salarian and neighbouring
gates: the Beneventans shut in the southern gates.
His attacks upon the walls were repulsed. Every one
took part in the struggle. Abbot Warnehar, the Frankish
minister, put on armour and worked day and night
upon the walls. The whole country round, with its
churches, villas, and dwellings, was mercilessly wasted.
The Lombards made a desert round Rome. Letter
after letter the Pope sent to Pipin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Father and Head of the Christian family was in
the utmost possible danger of beholding the spiritual
rights of his see and the people which he loved and
cared for, subjected to the half barbarous domination of
intruders, who, for nearly two hundred years, had forced
themselves upon Italy. In those two centuries the
possession of Rome, and lordship over it, had been the
coveted prize first of their heathen, and then of their
semi-Christian ambition. The rule of the Goth, much
nobler in his natural character, and much less savage,
had yet failed, even under the genius of Theodorich, to
amalgamate itself with Roman thought, law, and usage.
The strong hand of the great Gothic king had seemed
to tame it: as soon as he was gone, it corrupted his
grandson, and murdered his daughter and heiress,
Amalasunta, too good and noble for her people. But
the prospect of having to submit to an Aistulf, and his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ferocious nobles, was worse than the Gothic servitude
had been, which yet had subjected the free election of
their Father and Pontiff by the Roman clergy and
people to a foreign domination. And this domination
from Odoacer to Leo III. regarded not the good of the
Church, but the ends of Byzantine or Lombard.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The siege<a id="noteref_191" name="noteref_191" href="#note_191"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">191</span></span></a>
had entered into the third month when
tidings came that the king of the Franks was on his way
to answer the appeal of Pope Stephen. In April, 756,
he passed Mont Cenis. Again the enemy did not venture
to defend the Alpine passes. It would seem that
Aistulf had not expected so early a movement. The
siege of Rome was broken up. The siege of Pavia took
its place. Pavia yielded sooner than Rome. Pipin was
still in camp before the city when a mission from the
Greek emperor appeared to desire the surrender to the
empire of the lands which had been or were to be taken
from the Lombards. Here was seen in what sense the
king of the Franks had understood the word <span class="tei tei-q">“restitution”</span>.
The eastern deputies promised rich presents to
Pipin,<a id="noteref_192" name="noteref_192" href="#note_192"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">192</span></span></a> if
he would give back Ravenna and the other cities and
fortresses of its territory to the empire. The king of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page364">[pg 364]</span><a name="Pg364" id="Pg364" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Franks replied that for nothing on earth would he
suffer those cities to be taken from the rule of St. Peter,
the jurisdiction of the Roman Church, or of the pontiff
of the Apostolic see. He declared upon oath that for
no man's favour had he repeatedly entered into this
conflict, but only for the love of St. Peter and the pardoning
of his sins, adding that no amount of treasure
could persuade him to take away what he had once
given to St. Peter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then Aistulf, in fear of losing everything, asked for
peace. The Frank nobles in the army who had previous
connections with the Lombard, managed the agreement.
Aistulf not only ratified the previous contract, but surrendered
the third of his treasure, and promised the
payment of a tribute which had been paid in the time
of the dukes. Pipin presented to the Pope a solemn
document respecting the gift of the conquered territory.
The Abbot of St. Denys, accompanied by the Lombard
Commissioner, with full powers, executed the agreement
and the royal will. Upon arriving at Rome, he laid the
keys of the cities ceded by the Lombard upon the tomb
of the Prince of the Apostles. The exarchate and the
Pentapolis, and a large portion of Umbria, were to
belong to the Roman Church, and partly then, and
partly later, came into its actual possession, on one side
from Comacchio, in the swampy lowlands along the
Adriatic coast, down to what was afterwards the mark
of Ancona; on the other side as far as Narni, not far
from the confluence of the Nera and the Tiber, where
the duchy of Rome began. That it did not need. If
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg 365]</span><a name="Pg365" id="Pg365" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the distant emperor exercised nominal authority there,
the virtual authority had long belonged to the Pope,
who ruled there with acceptance of the people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was the summer of 756. About the end of the
winter Aistulf died through a fall from his horse, hunting.
After his death ensued a struggle for the throne.
The monk Rachis strove again for the sovereignty,
which Desiderius, duke in Tuscany, contested. It is not
clear how parties in the Lombard kingdom had been
so transformed that he who had been compelled once to
quit the throne for yielding to Rome now was unsuccessful
against a competitor favoured by Rome. But
this one bought his victory dearly. He renounced in
favour of the Church several cities not mentioned by
name in Pipin's gift, from Ferrara and Bologna down to
south of Ancona. At the same time Spoleto and Benevento
put themselves under protection of the Pope and
the king of the Franks, as the dukes and nobles swore
fidelity. <span class="tei tei-q">“This change is of the hand of the Lord,”</span>
wrote Pope Stephen to Pipin at the beginning of 757.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the course of a few years a new State, the State of
the Church, had been founded.<a id="noteref_193" name="noteref_193" href="#note_193"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">193</span></span></a> For a new State it was,
even if its connection with the empire was not dissolved.
Its geographical position in the centre of the Peninsula
and touching both seas, enhanced its importance. The
moment was great and decisive. The times of the
Roman empire were fulfilled. East and West had more
and more decidedly parted, as well especially on the
field of theological science as on the field of political
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page366">[pg 366]</span><a name="Pg366" id="Pg366" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
formations. Agreement had become impossible unless
the West was willing to give up its civilising mission.
Italy's political formation was closely bound up with
that mission. The Gothic domination had fallen inasmuch
as it had been powerless to assimilate land and
people. The Lombard people, inferior in energy and in
warlike qualities to the Goths, in its late attempt to
unite Italy under one sceptre, had failed less through
the weak resistance of the last remains of the Roman
empire than through the deep-lying failures of its political
and military constitution. These showed themselves
soon after its permanent occupation to the south
of the Alps by its parting into numerous military fiefs,
with slight internal connection. Moreover, the instability
of relation between the two nationalities from the
beginning made almost impossible the task which Liutprand
and Aistulf had set themselves. Attempts to
assimilate in life, custom, and law had followed a long
period of barbarous oppression, when the hand of the
Church had already enfolded conquerors and conquered.
These attempts had there produced a reaction which
threatened to undo what had been accomplished. After
two hundred years of settlement the Lombards were
still held to be strangers. Not to mention numerous
other tokens of this, it has a deep meaning when under
the successor of Pope Stephen <span class="tei tei-q">“the whole Senate and
all the people of the God-protected city of Rome”</span> write
to king Pipin concerning the extension of this province
<span class="tei tei-q">“rescued by you out of the hand of the heathen”</span>.<a id="noteref_194" name="noteref_194" href="#note_194"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">194</span></span></a> The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page367">[pg 367]</span><a name="Pg367" id="Pg367" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
national Italian elements made their complete effect
sensible in the State of the Church, and secured its
establishment in opposition to that temper of aliens represented
by the Lombards. The new temper
was not one-sided and exclusive, but assimilating,
and therefore certain of development and progress.
Never has a State arisen under circumstances so
remarkable, in the midst of a violent shock, yet
with so general a concurrence. It was due to the consistently-pursued
management of a series of distinguished
men as the result of their moralising influence. This
did not limit itself to the populations immediately
participating in it, which had found steady advocates and
actual protectors in the Popes, notwithstanding the
extreme need and oppression suffered by them. It
embraced the whole Christian world. The Church
absolutely required secular independence in order to
maintain in living energy this moralising influence, to
fulfil this her great mission. This necessity must appear
clear to every one if there were in the history of Italy
and the Papacy no other period than that of the last
Lombard times, or that following when the Carlovingian
rule was falling to pieces. The foundation of the
temporal power was no artificial plan devised by
Gregory II. for himself and his successors when he began
the great battle against the Iconoclasts. It was a
necessity in the world's history, developing itself rapidly,
yet step by step, out of the situation of things both in
politics and religion. And as if it should not want a
legitimate title also, the new formation rose at a moment
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page368">[pg 368]</span><a name="Pg368" id="Pg368" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
when, independently of action on the part of the Popes,
the whole claim of the empire practically disappeared in
the centre of Italy. It was recognised by the Popes
alone even when scarcely anything more remained of it
than a mere form and name.

To Aistulf, Between The Goth, The Lombard, And
The Byzantine.</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I propose to give a continuous review of the Roman
pontiff's position in the city of Peter from the plundering
of imperial Rome by the Vandal Genseric in 455 to
the siege of papal Rome and desolation of the Campagna
by the Lombard king Aistulf, beginning January 1, 756.
This attack was followed in that year by the enfranchisement
of Rome and the gift of the exarchate by Pipin,
king of the Franks, to St. Peter and his successors, when
he laid the keys of the cities surrendered by the Lombards
on the tomb of the Prince of the Apostles.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Three hundred years of suffering unbroken and of
glory unsurpassed which preceded the passage of the
Roman pontiff from servitude to sovereignty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The sun of imperial Rome set for ever when the
degenerate grandson of the great Theodosius, great
grandson also of Valentinian, whose name he covered
with infamy, perished by the stroke of an assassin in the
Campus Martius, the result of a life in which he imitated
the crime of Tarquin. But Tarquin's crime led to Rome's
freedom, the crime of Valentinian III. brought the end
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page370">[pg 370]</span><a name="Pg370" id="Pg370" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the imperial city, and the substitution of a Rome
built upon revealed truth and eternal justice for the
Rome of secular pride and unjust conquest.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In these three hundred years the brother Apostles, the
fisherman and the tentmaker, took the place of the
robber brothers, Romulus the slayer, and Remus the
slain, when the twelve centuries of augured dominion
were exactly fulfilled, and in the time of St. Leo the Great
the twelve vultures had had their full flight.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The three hundred years begin with the formal
acknowledgement of St. Leo's primacy, as consisting in
the descent from St. Peter, bearer of the keys and feeder
of the flock, made to him by the Council of Chalcedon
in the letter soliciting the confirmation of their decrees
by him; a letter to which the eastern emperor Marcian,
husband of the noble grand-daughter and heiress of
Theodosius, adds his own request for confirmation, and
with his wife, St. Pulcheria, in his character as the head
of the temporal power, acknowledges St. Leo, the Pope,
as <span class="tei tei-q">“the very person entrusted by the Saviour with the
guardianship of the vine”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The three hundred years end with the Pope emerging
a temporal sovereign from the Iconoclast persecution.
The eastern empire also has fulfilled its work in these
three centuries, and the soldier of fortune, who, at the
end of many revolutions has become the successor of
Marcian, has ridden his warhorse into the Church of God,
and attempted to substitute himself as its governor for the
successor of St. Peter, to dictate its creed, and interfere
with its worship. In recompense he is expelled from the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page371">[pg 371]</span><a name="Pg371" id="Pg371" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Italy which he and his predecessors had stripped and
sacrificed during two hundred years. Then the crown of
temporal sovereignty is added to the papal mitre of
spiritual power, which Leo the Isaurian had sought to
displace. And, moreover, the <span class="tei tei-q">“advocate of the Church,”</span>
who, <span class="tei tei-q">“as Christian prince and Roman emperor,”</span> had
used <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">against</span></em> the Church the very God-given power
which it was his first duty to use <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for</span></em> her, was on the eve
of seeing the same powerful race which had enfranchised
Rome and dowered the Roman See exalted to the
imperial throne in the face of both the Byzantine and
the Saracen. The emperor of the East had lowered his
dignity to the poor ends of ambition, and the task of
degrading God's Church. In Leo the Isaurian, and in
his son Kopronymus we see, in fact, that the man who sits
on the throne of the first Christian emperor is become
the chief enemy of the Church. The deeds of Heraclius
and Constans II. had given adequate cause for the
Divine Providence to allow the rise of Mohammed
and the severance of its eastern and southern provinces
for ever from the empire of Constantine and Theodosius.
Thereupon Leo and his son Kopronymus interpreted the
lesson thus given as entitling them to meet the assumption
of the prophet-emperor enthroned in the Damascus
which had ceased to be theirs with equal arrogance in
the counter assumption to be emperor-priest. The enemy
from Mecca had seized Both Powers in his claim to be
prophet; the enemy at Byzantium seized both as emperor.
Civil power was the appendage to Mohammed, but became
the root of spiritual authority to Leo the Isaurian.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page372">[pg 372]</span><a name="Pg372" id="Pg372" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us now retrace the period of civic disaster which
the Popes encountered from the last years of St. Leo the
Great. The following may be considered the main
causes:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First of all is the domination, not of barbarians only,
but of heretical barbarians, as Pope Gelasius termed
Odoacer.<a id="noteref_195" name="noteref_195" href="#note_195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">195</span></span></a> In that passage of his letter the Pope says
that when <span class="tei tei-q">“Odoacer occupied the realm of Italy he had
enjoined things to be done which were not lawful, but
to which we, by the help of God, would, as is well
known, not submit”</span>. He speaks in the name of
his see, but what the acts alluded to were we do not
know. The domination of Odoacer and of Theodorich
after him was Arian. It lasted at least sixty years, from
476 to 536. It was the policy of Theodorich to treat
Rome well, in its civil aspect. He fostered the Senate,
keeping it in quiet subjection to himself. He professed
to treat Italian and Goth on equal terms. As long as
the Acacian schism lasted, which effectually prevented
unity of action between the emperors Zeno and
Anastasius and the Popes who had ceased to be their
subjects, but who regarded the Roman emperor with all
the consideration required by Roman loyalty to the
head of the Roman name, the Gothic king observed this
conduct of neutrality; but when a new emperor, Justin
I., had acknowledged all the demands of Pope Hormisdas
and began to act as a Catholic emperor, Theodorich
dropped the mask and appeared as he was, the head and
bond of the whole Arian league in the West. Pope
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page373">[pg 373]</span><a name="Pg373" id="Pg373" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Symmachus died in 514. The Acacian schism at that
time was in full force; the emperor Anastasius full of
enmity and deceit against the Pope. Theodorich
allowed Hormisdas to be elected Pope after a vacancy
of the see for one single day. Hormisdas died in 523,
and a vacancy of six days only ensued, when Pope John
I. was allowed to be freely elected. In the meantime the
acts of the emperor Justin I. roused the full Arian spirit
in Theodorich. He allowed Pope John I. to be freely
elected, which did not prevent him from compelling that
Pope to go as his ambassador to Constantinople in order
to gain indulgence for the eastern Arians. And he
uttered the threat that he would fill Italy with blood if
his demands were not complied with. And when Pope
John I. came back crowned with honours rendered to
him as the first Pope who had ever visited the eastern
capital, Theodorich threw the Pope into prison, and he
never came out alive from the royal dungeon at
Ravenna.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This fact throws back a full and disastrous light upon
the whole Arian domination in Italy. A poet of our
day has put in the mouth of the doomed Gothic princess,
the royal-hearted Amalasunta, words of her
father:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I never loved that Apostolic Throne!</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a id="noteref_196" name="noteref_196" href="#note_196"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">196</span></span></a>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
the truth of which is a striking epitome of history. No
Arian ruler <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">could</span></em> love that Apostolic Throne. But we
learn from the fact what the Popes must have gone
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page374">[pg 374]</span><a name="Pg374" id="Pg374" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
through from the period when Rome fell under the rule
of northern condottieri to the expulsion of the Goths
under Belisarius and Narses. It is impossible that one
who denied the Godhead of the Master should look, with
love and veneration, upon the successor of the Disciple.
If the Shepherd of shepherds be not God Himself, the
Shepherd, who acts in His name, will not be received,
as invested with supreme and universal spiritual power.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us examine the connection of Arian domination
over Rome and Italy, as exercised, first, by Odoacer, and,
secondly, by Theodorich, with the eastern throne's
position and claim.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Odoacer exercised the authority which he held in
Rome and in Italy, with the approval of the emperor
Zeno. He compelled the Roman Senate to send to
Zeno at Constantinople the insignia of the western
emperor's dignity, together with the declaration that a
western emperor was no longer required; and that one
emperor seated at Constantinople was sufficient. In
return, he was invested by Zeno with the title of Patricius
of Rome. It may be said that Zeno could do
nothing else at the time: and that Odoacer's power
was really the power of the sword. Nevertheless, the emperor
of the East had become the sole Roman emperor.
The Popes acknowledged him as such, and continually
called upon him to discharge the duty of protection
to the Church of God, which belonged to the head
of the Roman Commonwealth. A few years later,
Zeno wished to be delivered from the near neighbourhood
of the stirring Gothic king, Theodorich. He commissioned
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page375">[pg 375]</span><a name="Pg375" id="Pg375" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Theodorich to lead his people into Italy, and
take possession of it. Five years of terrible conflict ensued
between the Herule and the Goth. They inflicted
great sufferings on the Italian cities. The Goth prevailed.
Ravenna was taken. There was a compact
made between Theodorich and Odoacer. A banquet
ensued, and in it Odoacer was slain. The first act of
Theodorich was to send an embassy to the emperor
Anastasius, who had succeeded Zeno, asking for the
crown of Italy from his hands. He was acknowledged
by Anastasius as the ruler of Italy, and as ruling it in
the imperial name. Theodorich became more and more
powerful, and if he did not expressly renounce the emperor's
over-lordship, he acted, in all respects, as the
sovereign of Italy, and of the great dominion which he
had attached to it. But the Byzantine sovereignty in
Italy was never resigned in the purpose of the emperor.
When, after 33 years of rule, Theodorich expired in
526, and Justinian speedily succeeded his uncle, Justin
I., the Gothic rule showed evident signs that it had been
built up by the extraordinary skill and energy of a
single man, but had entirely failed to assimilate the
Roman and the Gothic elements in a stable union.
When Justinian conquered the northern provinces of
Africa, and Rome, the old seat of the empire, by the
arm of Belisarius, he was, in his own mind, only recovering
his own, and reassuming what Zeno and
Anastasius had <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lent</span></em> to Odoacer and Theodorich. This
was the mind of every Byzantine sovereign from the
date of the western empire's extinction in 476, or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page376">[pg 376]</span><a name="Pg376" id="Pg376" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rather it was not extinguished to them, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they</span></em> had
become its lords. Herule, and Vandal, and Goth, and
Frank, and Burgundian, and whatever else those northern
savages called themselves, they were only encamped
on the sacred Roman soil, which belonged indefensibly
to the emperor who sat at Constantinople, the heir of
Constantine's Rome.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What has just been said will supply us, as I believe,
with a key to the whole conduct of the eastern emperors.
I will review it under three heads: first, Byzantine
despotism as exhibited in secular government:
secondly, Byzantine despotism as pushed into theological
doctrine: thirdly, Byzantine despotism, as laying
claim to the government of the Church. The three together
make up the thing which has received the name
of Byzantinism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first vacancy of the Holy See, after the extinction
of the western emperor by the death of Pope Simplicius,
in 483, witnessed the beginning of the Acacian schism.
The connection of that schism with the making Zeno
sole Roman emperor I have already traced in a former
volume. It also marks the beginning of the aggression
by the civil power ruling Rome with the title of
Patricius bestowed by Zeno, but really with the unrestricted
power of the barbarian sword, upon the freedom
of Papal election.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When, on the death of Pope Simplicius in 483, they
were assembled at St. Peter's for the election of his successor,
Basilius, prefect of the prætorium, and patricius,
representing also king Odoacer, rose and said that the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg 377]</span><a name="Pg377" id="Pg377" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
late Pope had given Odoacer the most earnest charge to
guard against any injury being done to the Church,
upon his own death, by being present, and sharing in
the election. Odoacer<a id="noteref_197" name="noteref_197" href="#note_197"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">197</span></span></a> did not go so far as to claim
authority to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">confirm</span></em> the election. No such power was
then recognised either in the eastern emperor, or in the
actual ruler of Rome. Pope Gelasius was elected in
492; Pope Anastasius in 496; they were chosen in
Rome; they took possession of the chair of Peter immediately
upon their election; they then informed the
emperor of their accession, or received first congratulations
from him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pope Symmachus in 498 followed Pope Anastasius.
And here acts of great importance took place. The
Acacian schism had then divided the East from Rome.
Zeno, in order to unite the Monophysites with the
Catholics, had drawn up an ambiguous formulary of
union called the Henotikon. The emperor Anastasius
was most desirous to maintain this formulary. He also
wished to recover union with Rome. When the
Senator Festus came to Constantinople on the embassy
of Theodorich, he promised the emperor that he would
induce Pope Anastasius to accept this formulary. But
Festus, returned to Rome, found Anastasius dead, and
Symmachus chosen by the greater part of the clergy to
succeed. He saw that there was no chance of inducing
Symmachus to accept the formulary. But Festus was
able to raise a schism, and set up, as Antipope, Laurentius.
After great troubles, which lasted four years,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page378">[pg 378]</span><a name="Pg378" id="Pg378" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Symmachus was established: but neither the emperor
nor Theodorich exercised or claimed authority to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">confirm</span></em>
his election.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In 514 Theodorich, the king of Italy, allowed the
election of Pope Hormisdas to take place without interference:
and again the election of Pope John I. in 523.
But upon the death of that martyred Pope in 526, instead
of his former indulgence, a state of suspicion and
anger against Rome had taken possession of the mind
of Theodorich. He imposed upon the Romans the
choice of Pope Felix IV. It is supposed that at this
time he enacted that in future no one should ascend the
papal chair without the confirmation of himself and his
successors.<a id="noteref_198" name="noteref_198" href="#note_198"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">198</span></span></a>
Thus only can it be explained that after
this, on the death of a Pope the Apostolic Chair remained
vacant sometimes for months, and a large sum
had to be paid into the Gothic treasury for the deed of
confirmation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Very shortly after the death of Pope John I., and the
fellow-victims, Boethius and Symmachus, Theodorich
died, and was succeeded by his grandson, Athalarich,
eight years old, under the tutelage of his mother,
Amalasunta. During her regency Pope Felix IV. died
in 530. The electors were divided into a Gothic-Roman
and a national-Roman party.<a id="noteref_199" name="noteref_199" href="#note_199"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">199</span></span></a> The candidate of
the former, Bonifacius II., and of the latter, Dioscorus,
were both elected two days after the death of Pope
Felix, and both consecrated on the following Sunday:
and so without any confirmation from Ravenna. But
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page379">[pg 379]</span><a name="Pg379" id="Pg379" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the death of Dioscorus after twenty-eight days prevented
a schism, and Boniface was fully recognised as Pope.
Boniface, in dread of troubles which would arise at his
death, ventured to summon the clergy to St. Peter's,
and laid before them a decree to subscribe: upon which
he declared the deacon Vigilius to be his successor. But
feeling speedily that this act was contrary to the existing
laws of the Church, he called a second assembly of
the clergy, the senate, and the people of Rome, declared
himself to have violated the freedom and sanctity of the
Papacy, and caused in their presence the paper nominating
Vigilius to be burnt.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The next election took place in 532, according to the
usual conditions. The young king, Athalarich, was
made to defer the confirmation of Pope John II. for two
months.<a id="noteref_200" name="noteref_200" href="#note_200"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">200</span></span></a> The state of Rome in the meantime was
frightful. Every man sought to plunder the goods of
the Church. The Senate had passed a decree strictly
forbidding the alienation of church goods by candidates
for the Papacy. It was disregarded: and the only
resource for the new Pope was to appeal to the king and
beg him to confirm the senate's decree. Athalarich decided
that the decree should be inscribed on a marble
tablet, and set up in front of the court of St. Peter's.
But the Gothic king's help was purchased dearly, and
the fee for confirming a Pope was established at 3000
gold pieces.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such in fifty-one years was the result of Odoacer meddling
with the Papal election. Not only had the right
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page380">[pg 380]</span><a name="Pg380" id="Pg380" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to confirm been allowed to the civil ruler of Rome, but a
heavy money payment had been imposed for the confirmation,
and delay superadded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In that year, 534, the young King Athalarich perished
at the age of eighteen by his own excesses. The Queen
Amalasunta speedily lost her power. She nominated
her cousin, Theodatus, of the royal blood of Amali, king.
He repaid her by allowing her to be murdered. His
name and character became odious to the Romans. On
the death of Pope John II. in 535 he allowed the free
choice of the Roman Agapetus to take place in seven
days. But he exercised great tyranny over the Romans.
He forced Pope Agapetus to go to Constantinople as his
ambassador. When that Pope died, as we have seen, in
the eastern capital, he imposed on the Romans the
choice of Silverius as Pope, threatening with death any
one who did not consent to his appointment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is the briefest possible record of how the original
liberty of the Roman clergy and people to elect the Pope
was treated by the foreign Arian rulers, Odoacer, Theodorich,
Athalarich, and Theodatus. Then the emperor
Justinian became by right of conquest immediate lord
of Rome, and seized without scruple upon the appointment
and confirmation of the Popes. The act of his
empress Theodora, in her violent deposition of Pope
Silverius, is the first specimen of Byzantine conduct
when it enters by right of conquest upon Italian territory.
That the Romans had every reason to wish for
the extinction of foreign, which was also heretical,
domination, must be clear to every one who follows
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page381">[pg 381]</span><a name="Pg381" id="Pg381" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
history in its detail. But likewise the example with
which Byzantine domination in Italy opens will suffice
to represent to us in a living picture the permanent
relation of the Popes to the eastern or Greek empire.
If arbitrary<a id="noteref_201" name="noteref_201" href="#note_201"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">201</span></span></a>
violations of the freedom of Papal election
by the Gothic kings may be given as the exception, it
became by frequent repetitions under Justinian the
rule. As the patriarchal see of Constantinople had long
been given only to select Court favourites, and taken
away from the occupants at every change of imperial
inclination, the same plan was pursued henceforth with
the filling of the Apostolical See. The emperor issued
his edict: the Romans and the Pope were expected to
obey. Not even the domain of the Faith was kept free
to the Pope. In this also the attempt of the emperors
was to lower the chief dignity of the Church to be the
echo of their commands.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From Justinian onwards the Byzantine emperors
claimed and exercised the right to confirm the papal
election.<a id="noteref_202" name="noteref_202" href="#note_202"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">202</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the ill-treated Vigilius died at Syracuse, returning
from his unhappy sojourn of eight years at Constantinople,
Justinian caused the archdeacon Pelagius, who had
been nuncio at Constantinople, to be elected his
successor. In like manner John III. in 560, and
Benedict I. in 574 were elected under pressure from the
emperor. But in 568 the Lombards came into Italy,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg 382]</span><a name="Pg382" id="Pg382" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and at the death of Benedict I. in 578 they were pressing
Rome so severely that no one could undertake the
journey to Constantinople to ask for imperial confirmation.
So the Book of the Popes says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Pelagius,<a id="noteref_203" name="noteref_203" href="#note_203"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">203</span></span></a> a
Roman, was consecrated without the command of the
emperor, because the Lombards were besieging the City
of Rome, and Italy was greatly laid waste by them.
There was such calamity as had not occurred in memory
of man.”</span> In 590 St. Gregory the Great waited six
months for his election to be approved at Constantinople.
What use was made by the eastern emperor of
the right to confirm the Papal election from the time
of St. Gregory to the breaking out of the Iconoclast
persecution has already been recounted. The last instance
of this degrading mark of servitude was the
confirmation of Pope Gregory III.'s election in 731 by
the exarch of Ravenna. From that time forth the Popes
elect were no longer confirmed by the emperor or his
delegate; and in 756 the hand of a western ruler made
them sovereign princes, and the much injured Italy was
relieved from eastern oppression so far at least as regarded
Rome and the central and northern provinces.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What took place at the death of a Pope was after this
fashion. The representation of the see was vested in the
three chief officers; the primicerius of the notaries, the
archpriest and the archdeacon informed of the fact the
exarch of Ravenna. They addressed their letter thus:
<span class="tei tei-q">“To the most excellent and distinguished lord, long to
be preserved by God for us in the discharge of his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page383">[pg 383]</span><a name="Pg383" id="Pg383" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
supreme office, N., ex-consul, patricius, and exarch of
Italy, N., the archpriest, N., the archdeacon, N., the
primicerius of the notaries, keeping the place of the holy
Apostolic See”</span>. The exsequies of the late Pope took
place, and a three days' fast and prayer preceded the act
of election. In this act took part the higher clergy with
the whole spirituality, the more important magistrates of
the city, the nobility, the deputies of the people, and such
Greek troops as might be present in the city. When the
election was completed the elect was conducted in solemn
procession to the Lateran, where he received the first
homage of the people. The electors subscribed the
decree of election which in the meantime had been prepared,
and laid it up for future record in the archive. A
second shorter copy was sent to the emperor at Constantinople,
which ended with the words:<a id="noteref_204" name="noteref_204" href="#note_204"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">204</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“wherefore
we, all your servants, in our sorrow beseech that the
piety of our masters may favourably receive the
entreaties of their servants, and by their grant of their
permission would allow the desires of their petitioners to
take effect for the good of their empire by their own
command. So that in virtue of their sacred letters we,
being under the same pastor, may solicit without ceasing
the almighty God and the Prince of the Apostles, who
has granted the appointment of a worthy governor of
his Church, for the life and empire of our most serene
masters.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet more submissive is the tone of the letter to the
exarch. After the election has been fully described, it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page384">[pg 384]</span><a name="Pg384" id="Pg384" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
continues: <span class="tei tei-q">“This being so, most exalted God-protected
master, we yet more earnestly entreat that by God's
quick operation inspiring your heart you would give
command to adorn the Apostolic See with the perfect
consecration of our father and pastor, as by the grace
of Christ happily and faithfully discharging your
execution of the imperial supremacy, so that we, your
humble servants, seeing our desire more rapidly fulfilled,
may be enabled to return unceasing thanks to God, to
the imperial clemency, and to your admirable government
willed by God. Thus, by the appointment of the
Pontiff of the Apostolic See, our spiritual pastor, we may
pour forth continual prayers for the life and safety and
complete victory of our most Christian masters. For
we know that the prayer of him whom by God's will we
elect to the supreme pontifical dignity, will propitiate
the divine power, and obtain for the Roman empire all
the success which it can desire. It will also preserve
your own power, under God's protection, for the ruling
of this captive Italian province, for the protection of us,
all your servants, and for the continuation of long deeds
of arms.”</span><a id="noteref_205" name="noteref_205" href="#note_205"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">205</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The three Papal officers also informed the archbishop
of Ravenna, the magistracy, and the Roman nuntio
there, of what had taken place, beseeching their assistance
that the confirmation of the election might speedily
be given. When this arrived from Constantinople and
Ravenna, the Pope elect received consecration. The
seven regions of Rome were represented in a procession
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page385">[pg 385]</span><a name="Pg385" id="Pg385" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which conducted him from the sacristy of St. Peter's to
the Confession of the Prince of the Apostles, where he
recited his profession of faith. Thereupon Mass began
to the Gloria, the bishops of Albano and Porto led him
to the bishop of Ostia, who was seated in an elevated
chair. They held the gospels over his head, and said
the first and second prayer. Then the bishop of Ostia
completed the proper consecration, while the archdeacon
laid the pallium upon him. After this, the new Pope
ascended the papal throne, gave his blessing to all the
priests, and proceeded with the sacrifice of the Mass.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A papal vacancy was reckoned from the burial of the
deceased Pope to the consecration of the Pope elect.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This power of confirming the election of a Pope, in
complete derogation from the original liberty, which
had only once been broken by the tyranny of the first
Constantius, in the year 355, down to the Arian occupation
of Rome by Odoacer, appears to have been exercised
from the last days of Theodorich in 526 down to Pope
Gregory III. in 731. The emperor Constantine the
Bearded, had, after the Sixth Council, suffered Pope
Benedict II., in 684, to be freely elected: but his son,
Justinian II., reimposed the yoke.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The weight of imperial pressure upon Rome had
been considerably affected by the Lombard occupation
of the northern provinces of Italy, beginning in 568.
The capture of Italy as a province, won for Justinian
by the conquest of Narses, was only completed in 555.
In thirteen years the Lombards entered upon the country
which the Goths had well nigh reduced to ruin.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page386">[pg 386]</span><a name="Pg386" id="Pg386" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Lombard aggression ran well nigh side by side with
Byzantine oppression for two centuries. Right in the
midst of both the Apostolic See was placed. In 596,
the great St. Gregory complained that he had been
keeping watch and ward against these new northern
robbers for twenty-eight years, which is the second arm
of Byzantine oppression.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The exarch, in the judgment of the despotic Justinian
and his successors, was a viceroy of all Italy, planted
in the fortress of Ravenna, one side of which was
guarded by the sea, the other by marshes. Thence
Theodorich ruled: there he was buried: and the
Byzantine only felt secure in the Gothic stronghold.
Defenceless Rome was stretched out beneath his feet in
central Italy, or, if it had a defence, it was that the
deathless spirit of the Apostolic See lived within the
walls of Aurelian, and animated by its guardianship
the often broken and rudely repaired towers of the
world's ancient mistress. The exarch was the choice
instrument of the emperor's despotism. St. Gregory,
in his fourteen years' struggle with all the elements of
civil dissolution, accounts the exarch Romanus as his
worst enemy. He was always ready to combine with
the Lombard, then in the depths of savagery and
ignorance, against his own lord's liege vassals in Rome.
Thus St. Gregory unbosoms himself to Sebastian, bishop
of Sirmium:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Words cannot express what we suffer
from your friend, the lord Romanus. I would say, in a
word, that his malice towards us surpasses the swords
of the Lombards. The enemies who destroy us seem
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page387">[pg 387]</span><a name="Pg387" id="Pg387" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to us kinder than the magistrates of the Commonwealth,
who wear out our thoughts by their ill-will, their
plundering, and their deceit. At one and the same
time to have the care of bishops and clergy, of monasteries
and people, to watch carefully against enemies in
ambuscade, to be exposed even to suspicion by the
deceit and ill-will of rulers—the labour and the sorrow
of this your brotherhood can the better weigh by the purity of
your affection for me who suffer it.”</span><a id="noteref_206" name="noteref_206" href="#note_206"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">206</span></span></a> These
words may fitly introduce us to the Byzantine exarchate
as a government. In the thirty years succeeding
St. Gregory, the exarch appears as the great manager
of Papal elections: from which his least hostile act
would be to extort a fee as great, at least, as that laid
down in the last Gothic time as 3000 gold coins. Now
and then, as opportunity offered, he would enjoy the
greater luxury of plundering the Lateran treasury of
the Church at his leisure: as done by the exarch Isaac
in 638, who was immortalised for the deed in the inscription
of his tomb at Ravenna, as the most faithful
servant of his most serene masters at Constantinople.
The exarch Olympius, in 648, received from his master,
Constans II., the higher commission to murder St. Martin,
as he was giving holy Communion. But the attempt
was frustrated, as was believed at the time, by a divine
intervention. However, the exarch Theodore Kalliopa,
sent for the special purpose, succeeded in carrying off
Pope St. Martin, as he lay ill before the altar of the
Lateran, five years later in 653, and placing him in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page388">[pg 388]</span><a name="Pg388" id="Pg388" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hands of Constans II., to be condemned for high treason,
in that he had not waited for the confirmation of
his election by Constans, but, instead, had condemned
his heresy in the great Council which he summoned at
Rome. In the interval of twenty-five years, from the
death of St. Martin to the opening of the Sixth Council,
the exarchs were faithful to the imperial tradition until
Constantine the Bearded renounced the heresy of
which his father, Constans, and his grandfather, Heraclius,
had been the chief supporters, while they were
nursed in it by a succession of Byzantine patriarchs.
But when Justinian II. had followed, the exarch John
Platina, in 687, hurried from Ravenna to Rome to
hinder the election of the great pontiff, Sergius. Finding
it accomplished, he was obliged to content himself
with fining the new Pope to the extent of a hundred
pounds' weight of gold, that being the bribe which the
unsuccessful candidate had promised him if he would
come to Rome to secure his election. Four years afterwards,
Justinian II., unable to induce Pope Sergius
to accept the decrees of his Council in Trullo, or to
accept the place for his signature of them which the
emperor had provided in a line between his own signature
and that of his patriarch, sent Zacharias not an
exarch, but a guardsman, to repeat, if possible, in the
person of Pope Sergius, what had been done forty years
before in the person of Pope St. Martin. But, instead, the
emperor's own troops caused the guardsman to tremble
for his life. His only place of refuge was under the bed
in the Pope's own chamber: the Pope's intercession
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page389">[pg 389]</span><a name="Pg389" id="Pg389" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
alone saved the imperial emissary from a fatal outburst
of Italian wrath. Yet ten years later, under the upstart
emperor Apsimar, in his short reign, another
exarch, Theophylact, was again repulsed from his execution
of an intended attack on the Pope by Italian
soldiers. Once more, when Pope Constantine, obeying
an imperial letter of the restored Justinian II., had left
Rome for Constantinople, several chief Papal officers
were summarily executed at Rome. Thus the five
attempts on the life of the Pope Gregory II. made by
exarchs or guardsmen, at the bidding of the emperor
Leo III., in his Iconoclastic fury, were but the consistent
continuation of the spirit shown by the exarchs, and
fostered and supported by the emperors, from the time
of St. Gregory's adversary, the Lord Romanus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During these two hundred years, from the first inroad
of the Lombards, nothing could be more embarrassing
than the civil position of the Popes. Beside the main
body of the Lombards, occupying the great plain of
North Italy, with their capital at Pavia, there were two
duchies, one of Spoleto, immediately to the north of
Rome and its territory, and another of Benevento, holding
a considerable portion of Italian territory near
Naples. This city, with other seaports, continued in
possession of the empire. The Lombard kings were
evermore trying to bring their outlying duchies into
closer obedience to the royal power. Again the fortress
and territory of Ravenna, the imperial metropolis, lay
further to the north, touching the Lombard possessions.
The Lombards, when they came into Italy, were so little
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page390">[pg 390]</span><a name="Pg390" id="Pg390" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
advanced in political science of government, so little
coherent among themselves, that at one time they were
divided among thirty-six chiefs, so many heads of
robbers and devastating bands, barbarous and un-Christian.
There can be no doubt that the aim of the Lombard
kings from the beginning had been to make themselves
masters of Rome, and to rule the whole of Italy
as a kingdom. The example and success of Theodorich
was fresh before them. Justinian's success under his
generals Belisarius and Narses was even younger than
the glory of the great Gothic king. Gregory the Great
had laid a foundation for christianising the Lombard
people in his friendship with the great and good Queen
Theodelinda. In process of time they had become
Catholic. Their king, Liutprand, had caused the relics
of St. Augustine, which had been carried from Africa to
Sardinia during the Vandal persecution, to be brought
to his capital city, Pavia, where the shrine of the greatest
of the fathers still abides in honour. Pope Zacharias,
by his personal dignity, prevailed over both Liutprand
and Rachis. But the contest for the dominion of Italy
went on in spite of reverence for the Apostolic See. The
people were Catholic, but tumultous and stubborn.
After a long-continued struggle of various success, the
king Liutprand seemed to be on the point of incorporating
the Spolentine and Beneventan duchies, of closing
upon Rome, and expelling the emperor from Ravenna.
Upon his death, and the retirement of Rachis, Aistulf
was uniting all the Lombard force for the attainment of
their purpose from the beginning, to expel the emperor
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page391">[pg 391]</span><a name="Pg391" id="Pg391" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from Italy, and to make the Pope a Lombard subject.
He went so far as to put a poll-tax on the Roman duchy,
and to style himself king of Italy. There the Carlovingian
hand arrested him: and the keys of the cities
which the Lombard had won from the Byzantine, and
Pipin from the Lombard, laid by the gift of Pipin on
the tomb of the chief apostle, signified to all men that
his successor had become a temporal prince, after forming
Rome in the centre of a captive province from a
heathen city into a spiritual capital during the unceasing
calamity of three centuries. We have scarcely any
record of the indescribable sorrows which the Lombard
in his aggressive policy, and the Byzantine in his continuous
resistance, made up of treachery and bribery
added to insufficient military power, inflicted on the
cities and the people of Italy: nor of what the Popes
endured in their loyal acknowledgment of their duty as
subjects, and their unbroken tenacity in maintaining the
faith and government of the Church against the succession
of adventurers who mounted the Byzantine throne.
These culminated in the seven revolutions terminated
by that of Leo III. Then the strong man, armed, rode
his charger right into the Church of God and strove to
add the Popes of Rome to the number of patriarchs
whom he raised, deposed, blinded, and executed as he
pleased. He made them ecumenical and trod upon
them when so made, with the heel of the imperial
buskin. And now we come from the first oppression
in confirming the Pope, and the second in reducing
him to a captive vassal, to the third of subjecting
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page392">[pg 392]</span><a name="Pg392" id="Pg392" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
him as the chief teacher of the Church to the lay power
of the emperor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As we look back we see the whole mind of Justinian
photographed in his imperial legislation. When he had
to speak to the bishop of his capital his language ran:
<span class="tei tei-q">“To the most holy and blessed Archbishop of this Imperial
City, and Ecumenical Patriarch”</span>—the core of the
title was <span class="tei tei-q">“Bishop of this Imperial City,”</span> its corollary
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ecumenical Patriarch”</span>. To him the bishops of Alexandria,
Antioch, and Jerusalem were to submit any
appeal from the provinces subject to them. Rome was
not to be deposed from the prior rank acknowledged
once for all by the eastern monarch and episcopate at
the termination of the Acacian schism, in which act
Justinian himself, as the ruling nephew, had taken
notable part: but there was to be at Constantinople a
similar patriarch, whom the whole eastern world should
obey. From him the eastern bishops were to learn the
mind of the emperor, just as, when they attended the
court, he introduced them to the imperial presence.
The emperor would honour him by using him as his
chief ecclesiastical minister, who held the portfolio of
doctrine. The laws which all the world was to receive
bore this exaltation of the imperial bishop in their
bosom. And it must be confessed that in St. Gregory's
time the patriarchal title which Pope Gelasius had
utterly refused to the Byzantine bishop a century before,
had been conceded to him in St. Gregory's practice:
the patriarchal title, but not the ecumenical. Of
the patriarchs, when speaking of a fault to be condoned,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page393">[pg 393]</span><a name="Pg393" id="Pg393" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he wrote, <span class="tei tei-q">“if any of the four patriarchs had done this
we could not pass it over,”</span> and Constantinople must be
added to Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem to make
up this number of four: but of the assumed title of
ecumenical, he wrote that it was diabolical, and the forerunner
of anti-Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But another part of Justinian's conduct is no less
salient. He is not the first, indeed, but he is the chief
of the theologising emperors. The disastrous assumption
of dictating doctrine, and deciding in theological
controversies, which, at the moment of the fall of the
western empire, the insurgent Basiliscus had begun
during his short-lived reign, and Zeno continued, and
Anastasius reinforced, was taken up with far greater
force by Justinian. He laboured during eight years
just at the middle of the sixth century to exhibit Pope
Vigilius at Constantinople as the first of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></em> five
patriarchs: he made the bishop of his capital hold a
General Council without the Pope: he imposed his own
doctrinal lucubrations upon that Council. He raised
in the minds of the western bishops suspicions and
fears as to Pope Vigilius being forced to become his
instrument. The patriarch Epiphanius, who had weakly
yielded to him, he afterwards deposed. Pope Vigilius
escaped at last to die at Syracuse on his return to Rome
worn out with the <span class="tei tei-q">“contradiction of sinners”</span> which he
had experienced. In his person St. Peter had been a
captive; seeds of schism and distrust had been scattered
by Justinian in the West: which it required all the
wisdom, the energy, and the patience of the great St.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page394">[pg 394]</span><a name="Pg394" id="Pg394" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Gregory a generation later to overcome and root out.
The following theologising emperors, Heraclius, Constans
II., Justinian II., the poor phantom Philippicus Bardanes,
and lastly Leo III., were only completing and crowning
Justinian's double work, of making an ecumenical
patriarch, and an emperor behind him, the ultimate
judge of doctrine.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But had Leo III. succeeded in his attempt to grasp
spiritual and temporal power in one hand, the Church of
God would have come to an end. The whole future of
the world was touched by the issue of this conflict.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is to be remarked how immovable the Popes were,
not only in the maintenance of Christian doctrine pure
and proper, but likewise in the maintenance of that relation
between the Two Powers which Christian doctrine
requires as one of the conditions of its own action in the
world. What on this subject Pope Gelasius in the last
decade of the fifth century had said to the emperor
Anastasius, now after two hundred and thirty years Pope
St. Gregory II. was saying to the Iconoclast emperor
Leo. In the interval Italy had been governed by the
Byzantines, so far as they possessed it, during two
centuries as a subject province, the captive of its spear;
Rome had lived through it only in virtue of the Pope's
primacy. The eastern empire having been false to the
faith in its emperors and in many of its bishops, but
especially in four successive patriarchs of Constantinople,
had been cut in two, and one half of it given over to an
anti-Christian religion to rule with unrestricted violence.
And now the diminished emperor, who had just saved
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page395">[pg 395]</span><a name="Pg395" id="Pg395" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his capital from the Mohammedan chalif, had been
seduced by Jewish and Mohammedan principles to
sweep the Christian churches in his remaining dominion,
from Sancta Sophia to the least country church, free of
Christian symbols, beginning with the most sacred image
of the Redeemer<a id="noteref_207" name="noteref_207" href="#note_207"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">207</span></span></a>
which adorned the gate of his own
palace as the witness for the need of the oppressed.
Then St. Gregory II. stood up against Leo III. exactly
as his predecessor, Pope Gelasius, had resisted the
emperor of the former day. Syria and Egypt and North
Africa, and, still greater shame and peril, Spain had
become Mohammedan. The Pope stood, in 727, where
he had stood in 495. In the interval all these countries
had fallen: but St. Gregory II. could tell a furious
tyrant that all the nations of the West looked to St.
Peter as <span class="tei tei-q">“a god upon earth”</span>—that he could not execute
his threat to pull down the statue of St. Peter,
which the Christians of that day reverenced in his
basilica at Rome, which the Christians of eleven centuries
have reverenced since in the same place, and put
their head under the Apostle's foot as the acknowledgment
of the dignity with which Christ invested him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
St. Gregory II. told Leo, the Isaurian, that his own
imperial dignity was itself of divine institution, as the
organ of human government: while the ecclesiastical
dignity was of divine institution, in virtue of that
divine intervention by which alone men become sons
of God. The answer of the tyrant was five times to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page396">[pg 396]</span><a name="Pg396" id="Pg396" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
attempt the Pope's life, as that of a rebellious vassal
whom he was entitled to put under ban, and efface as a
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">natura ferina</span></span>.
But the issue of this contest was that
three Popes, St. Gregory II., St. Gregory III., St.
Zacharias, equally great, wise, and prudent, maintained
intact their Primacy: that their successor, Stephen II.,
was the first Pope who crossed the Alps; that he consecrated
the Carlovingian dynasty, and was accepted in
Rome triumphantly as her king. In this series of acts
he had also broken the chains of Italy, and a Pope presently
following, who had ceased to be an eastern vassal,
was to create a counterpoise to the chalif of Mohammed
in an emperor, not Byzantine, but Roman, not grasping
illicit power in the spirit of Saracenic pride, but as a
type of Christian monarchy placed at the head of lawful
government, not a perversion of Constantine and
Theodosius, but the loyal spirit of both embodied by a
divine consecration.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During the reigns of Leo III. and his son, Constantine
Kopronymus, and the times of the Popes Gregory II.,
Gregory III., Zacharias, and Stephen II., certain events
take place in the East and the West respectively, which,
by their striking contrast with each other, while they coincide
in the time of their happening, remarkably express
and sum up the course taken by the three centuries
which we are considering. Despotism matures in the
East, and barbaric savagery triumphs: freedom, order,
the majesty of nations growing into one faith, dawn
upon the West.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In 727 the yet existing letters of Pope Gregory II.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page397">[pg 397]</span><a name="Pg397" id="Pg397" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the emperor Leo exhibit that monarch as thoroughly
possessed with the claim to govern the Church as he
governs the State. In this he is as thoroughly encountered
by the Pope, who calls up against him the
unbroken tradition of the Church during the seven
centuries, and reminds him of the sad misfortunes of
those emperors who had attempted to carry their civil
authority into the domain of revealed truth. The great
eastern teacher, St. John of Damascus, then living in
the Syrian court of the chalif, lays this down in language
as peremptory as that of the Pope. The guilt
of Leo III. is heightened by the fact that he had before
him in the history of his own realm during the hundred
years preceding him the rise of a religion essentially
opposed to the Christian faith, which he was professing
himself to purify. Its force, ever exercised against
Christians with the utmost virulence and cruelty, was
centered in the fact that its chief deduced all civil
authority from the prophetic office of its founder. But
while the kingship of Mohammed, as inherited by his
chalifs, began with his attempt to found a religion, Leo,
in continuing and advancing to their utmost tension the
interferences of Justinian with the spiritual order, was
undoing the ancient laws of the empire for a hundred
and fifty years, from the time of Constantine to that of
Zeno. His own patriarch, Germanus, chose rather to lay
his omophorion on the altar, and depart into exile than
sanction and accept Leo's usurpation in sacred things.
The whole liberty, and with it the whole existence of
the Church, were comprehended in the resistance maintained
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page398">[pg 398]</span><a name="Pg398" id="Pg398" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by Pope Gregory, and attested by patriarch
Germanus as a victim. Gregory II. followed, in giving
to Cæsar the things of Cæsar, but to God the things of
God, the whole line of his predecessors. Leo III. imitated
wrongly the chief antagonist of the Christian
name; but Mohammed was at least consistent with
his original falsehood. In this his religion itself was
contained. Likewise the whole work of Christendom
was embodied in the victorious defence of Gregory
against the consummation of eastern despotism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The acts which followed by Pope and by emperor
agreed with their several principles. Gregory III. on
his accession at once endeavoured to bring the emperor
to a better mind. But Leo had already deposed
Germanus, and put Anastasius, a docile instrument,
in his stead. The Pope called a council at Rome, which
entirely supported the freedom of the Church. Leo
turned to brute force. He sent out a great fleet with
the commission to destroy his own metropolis, Ravenna,
then to advance upon Rome, seize the Pope, and carry
him away captive, as eighty years before St. Martin had
been taken. Five years after this violent act of despotism,
which the winds and seas had frustrated, Pope
Gregory III., pressed hard by the advancing arms of the
Lombard king, Liutprand, besought the great conqueror,
Charles Martell, to take up his defence. He appealed
to the piety of the Frank leader in behalf of St. Peter,
a piety extinct in the Roman emperor's breast. Two
years later Pipin had succeeded to the power of Charles
Martell, and intimated in the strongest manner the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page399">[pg 399]</span><a name="Pg399" id="Pg399" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
veneration for the Apostolic See felt by the Frank
people, in asking Pope Zacharias to pronounce as Pope
that Pipin might duly be elected king of the Franks.
Zacharias gave his decision: and the diet of the kingdom
at Soissons bore out to the full the sentence of
Pope Gregory II. in his letter to Leo III., that all the
nations of the West looked to St. Peter as a god upon
earth. Pipin became king of the Franks by the diet
of the Franks accepting the decision of Pope Zacharias
in 752, when in 733 the rough Isaurian soldier thought
only of subduing the predecessor of Zacharias, Gregory
III., by a dungeon in Byzantium after the mode of
Constans II. with St. Martin. But even yet the contrast
is not complete.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not only had Leo III., in his wrath at being foiled by
the elements, confiscated the patrimonies of the Church
in the southern provinces of Italy which he possessed,
and in Sicily, and in his realm generally, but he interfered
with the immemorial spiritual jurisdiction of the
Pope as patriarch, and assigned to his own patriarch at
Constantinople the privileges which by the appointment
of St. Leo had been given to the great metropolis,
Thessalonica. This jurisdiction the patriarchs of Constantinople
had coveted for centuries. Theodosius II.
had tried to give it them by an imperial decree: but it
was rescinded. Anastasius, who had been substituted
for Germanus in 730, received the ill-omened gift in
733. The giver's son, Kopronymus, afterwards punished
by blindness this unhappy man, but sent him back thus
blinded to occupy his see during ten years; made him
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page400">[pg 400]</span><a name="Pg400" id="Pg400" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
crown his son, and only in 753 Anastasius, becoming once
more a servile persecutor of images, terminated the
episcopate which he had so ingloriously received in 730.
On the other hand, Pope Stephen II., successor of
Zacharias, in spite of bodily weakness and continual
danger, crossed the Alps, crowned Pipin, his wife and his
sons, in the Abbey of St. Denys, in 754, and so consecrated
the Carlovingian race. The rising monarchy of
the Franks exulted in that very dignity of St. Peter's
successor, which the Byzantine monarch was striving to
subject to his own will.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But this contrast had a yet further and even more
striking issue. Pope Stephen II., hard pressed by the
resolute attempt of king Aistulf to make himself temporal
king of Rome, applied for defence to the man he
still recognised as sovereign, Constantine Kopronymus,
and received for answer only the words that he might
get it where he could. He beheld the Lombard destroying
and trampling on every thing outside the walls
of Rome. In the utmost bodily weakness he had taken
the road to Pavia: he resisted every effort of Aistulf
to detain him. He had been received by Pipin with
joy and admiration. Protection against the Lombards
was promised him. The Lombard king gave way to
his fear of the Frankish kings, but presently broke
through every engagement. On 1st January, 756, he
had promised himself Rome, and all which it contained.
By the end of the year he had surrendered the exarchate
to St. Peter, and Rome had accepted her Pontiff
Stephen as her king. And the name of Stephen II. is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page401">[pg 401]</span><a name="Pg401" id="Pg401" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
numbered with that of his three predecessors as the
maker of pontifical liberty. Kopronymus ventured to
ask Pipin to restore to him the cities which Pipin had
conquered. He received for reply that not for earthly
reward or wealth, but for the love of St. Peter, the
king of the Franks had bestowed on the Pope, his
successor, the cities which he had delivered from the
Lombard, and restored Rome to him by delivering it
from Lombard aggression.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Constantine Kopronymus had succeeded his father Leo
III. in 740. An insurrection arose against him in his
own house. It was put down with terrible severity.<a id="noteref_208" name="noteref_208" href="#note_208"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">208</span></span></a> These were his doings in Constantinople in the same
year 754, when Pipin was crowned by the Pope. He
had surpassed his father in the cruelty with which he
attempted to alter the existing worship of the Church.
He had obtained some advantage in war against the
Saracens, who were divided by the contest between the
Ommaiads and the Abbassides, but he thought not the
least of saving Italy from the Lombards, much more he
desired to deliver the churches from the sacred images.
For this purpose he caused many assemblies to be held and
addressed the people, moving them to destroy the images.
At last he held a Council at Constantinople of 338 bishops.
At their head stood Gregory, bishop of Neocesarea,
Theodosius, archbishop of Ephesus, a son of the emperor
Apsimar, Sisinnius, bishop of Perge in Pamphylia.
There was no patriarch, no representative from the sees
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page402">[pg 402]</span><a name="Pg402" id="Pg402" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Rome, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem. The see
of Constantinople was vacant, as Anastasius had just
died. The Council met on the Asiatic side, opposite
Constantinople, on the 10th February, 754, and sat six
months. Then on the 8th August it passed over to the
Church of Blachernæ. There the emperor presented
himself at the ambon holding by the hand the monk
Constantine, bishop of Sylæum, and cried with a loud
voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“Many years to the ecumenical patriarch Constantine.”</span>
At the same time he invested him with the
patriarchal robes and the pallium. The Council ended
that day, and nothing of it remains to us except a so-called
confession of faith in the acts of the Seventh
Ecumenical Council, the second of Nicæa, in 787, where
it was refuted and rejected.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Council of 787, called in the time of another
Constantine, the grandson of Kopronymus, when the
eastern emperor had returned for the moment to the
orthodox faith, has denounced this Council of 754 as
claiming most unlawfully the title of ecumenical. Being
confirmed by Pope Adrian I., it enjoys that title itself,
and its utter condemnation of the Council of 338 bishops
which met at the request of Kopronymus can be trusted.
Here it is sufficient to say that this Council of 754
covered Kopronymus and his little son Leo with acclamations
for having destroyed idolatry. When the emperor
and the new patriarch Constantine and the rest of the
bishops appeared in the square at Constantinople they
published the decree of the Council, and renewed their
anathemas against the patriarch Germanus and St. John
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page403">[pg 403]</span><a name="Pg403" id="Pg403" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Damascene. When the decree reached the provinces,
Catholics were everywhere dismayed; the Iconoclasts
began to sell the holy vessels and disorganise the churches.
The images were burnt, the pictures torn down or whitewashed;
only landscapes and the figures of birds and
beasts were retained, especially pictures of theatres, hunts,
and races. To bow before the images of Christ and of
the saints was forbidden; to bow before the emperor was
retained, and any insult to his figure upon a coin
punished with death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In 754, Kopronymus, holding Constantine by the hand,
presented him to the assembled bishops as his own choice
for ecumenical patriarch. Not only was the individual
his choice, but his father, Leo, twenty years before, had
made the office by constituting the spiritual jurisdiction of
the bishops of the capital conterminous with the empire,
in that he deprived the Pope in his quality of the first
patriarch of the ten provinces which from the beginning
had acknowledged his patriarchal superintendence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We may follow to his end the ecumenical patriarch
who had this beginning.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It seems that neither a bishop nor a secular priest in
the eastern empire ventured to oppose the decree of this
Council. But monks suffered the most fearful persecution.<a id="noteref_209" name="noteref_209" href="#note_209"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">209</span></span></a>
They were driven away and their monasteries
destroyed. Nor were these the worst blows which the
emperor dealt upon their institution. He invented truly
devilish means to make them contemptible and abhorred.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page404">[pg 404]</span><a name="Pg404" id="Pg404" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Some who had been banished from Constantinople
yielded to his will, subscribed the edict against images,
quitted their dress and married. Thereupon they
returned to the city, recovered all their civil rights,
were marked with favour, received the emperor's personal
attention. But those who remained true to their faith
and their habit experienced his utmost severity. A
month after his return from the war, the 24th August,
766, on which day he had appointed a chariot-race, he
caused the monks in the neighbourhood of Constantinople
to be brought together into the racecourse. There, as
the rows of seats were crowded with people, he compelled
each monk to pass in procession with a woman of bad
life beside him. Thus they suffered every indignity
which an excited populace could put upon them. The
bad courtiers saw that it was an evil stroke of the
emperor. Those who had not the secret thought that
they had been taken in company with these women.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This spectacle so pleased the emperor that, four days
afterwards, he repeated it with nineteen of his chief
officers, whom he charged with a conspiracy against him.
The real offence was the maintenance of the right belief,
the having had relation with the banished Stephen in his
exile at Proconnesus, and more than once to have praised
his constancy in suffering. He caused them to be led
round the racecourse, and made the crowd spit on them
and revile them. The two of highest account were
beheaded: two patricians, brothers, Constantine, who had
been controller-general of the posts, and Strategius, officer
in the life guards; the rest were blinded and banished
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page405">[pg 405]</span><a name="Pg405" id="Pg405" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to an island, nor did Kopronymus forget every year that
he lived to send thither executioners to inflict on each a
hundred strokes of oxhide. When he found that the
people grieved over the execution of Constantine and
Strategius, had not forborne tears, and even murmured,
he put down this to the fault of the prefect Procopius,
who ought to have suppressed these seditious cries; he
had him scourged and deprived.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The patriarch Constantine had received from the
emperor extraordinary and unfitting honours. They
were followed by public disgrace. The emperor learnt
that he had had intercourse with one of the accused for
conspiracy. He put up witnesses who declared that they
had heard expressions from him against the emperor.
This the patriarch absolutely denied, and proof was not
forthcoming. The emperor caused them secretly to confirm
their statement by an oath taken on the holy Cross.
Thereupon, without further proof he set seals upon the
door of the patriarchal palace, and banished the patriarch
to Prince's Island. Constantine was thus deposed on the
30th August, 766, and on the 16th November the
emperor, without regarding any canonical form, named
Nicetas to his place. The new patriarch was yet more
unfitted for so eminent a rank, being a eunuch and
slave by birth. From his youth he had only been
accustomed to attend on women, had scarcely learnt to
read; but the emperor, on recommendation of certain
ladies of the court, had caused him to be made a priest
and given him a post in the Church of the Apostles. Upon
entering the patriarchal palace Nicetas showed himself
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page406">[pg 406]</span><a name="Pg406" id="Pg406" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
worthy of the imperial choice, for he caused the magnificent
mosaics on the walls to be destroyed. These his
two predecessors had spared for their beauty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By similar services the highest dignitaries of the
kingdom were obtained. A zealous Iconoclast was in
the eyes of the emperor qualified for every civil or
military post. Thus Michael of Melissene, brother of
the empress Eudocia, was made governor of Phrygia,
Lachanodracon of Asia, and Manes of Galatia. At the
beginning of 767 Constantine sent these new and yet
more severe governors into the provinces, having just
before imposed an oath on all his subjects not to honour
images. Then began a general persecution of the
orthodox. Those governors showed themselves in the
provinces obedient instruments of their emperor's rage.
They profaned churches, persecuted monks, and destroyed
pictures. They tore relics of the saints from
their sanctuaries, and cast them into rivers or drains.
They mixed them with bones of animals, and burnt
them together, so that the ashes might not be distinguished.
The relics of the martyr St. Euphemia, in
whose church at Chalcedon the great Council had been
held, were its chief treasure. The emperor had the
shrine cast into the sea, changed part of the church
into an arsenal, and made the other part a place where
all the rubbish of the city might be shot. The waves
carried the shrine to the Isle of Lemnos, whose inhabitants
fished it up. Twenty years after the death of
Kopronymus, Irene, then reigning with her son Constantine,
caused this treasure to be brought back to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page407">[pg 407]</span><a name="Pg407" id="Pg407" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Chalcedon, the church to be purified and restored to its
former condition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The deposed patriarch Constantine had endured the
hardest treatment at Prince's Island during thirteen
months. The emperor had learnt that this unhappy
prelate had told to others an impious remark concerning
the Mother of God, which the emperor had made, and
enjoined silence about it. Furious in his wrath he
ordered him to be brought to Constantinople; he had
him beaten till he could not stand, and had him carried
in a litter to Sancta Sophia to be degraded. He was cast
down on the steps of the sanctuary. A court-secretary
read in presence of the whole assembly, called together
by the emperors order, a detailed accusation with loud
voice, and as he read each detail struck him with it in
the face. In the meantime Nicetas had mounted the
patriarchal chair, and presided over each insult which
his benefactor suffered. When the reading was finished,
Nicetas took the act of accusation, had Constantine
carried to the tribune, where he was held upright by
several, that the people might see him, made one of his
suffragans go up to pronounce the anathema, to take off
the episcopal robes, and with insulting expressions to
expel him from the church, from which he had to go
backwards.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The next day, a day of games in the circus, his beard,
eye-brows, and hair were torn out; he was dressed in
a short woollen smock without sleeves, put backwards
on an ass, and led through the circus by a nephew
whose nose had been cut off. The parties of the circus
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page408">[pg 408]</span><a name="Pg408" id="Pg408" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
reviled him and spat on him. At the end of the circus
he was thrown down, trodden under foot, and put upon
the stone which terminated the circus to be exposed
there, so long as the games lasted, to the jeers of the
riders as they passed. He was then thrown into prison,
where he lay almost forgotten to the 15th August of
the following year, 768. That day was the last of his
sufferings. The emperor sent two patricians to him to
ask what he thought of the emperor's belief and the
doctrine of the council. The sufferer, to the last a
courtier, thought by a submissive answer to alleviate
his punishment. He replied: <span class="tei tei-q">“The emperor's belief is
holy, and the council has issued a holy confession”</span>. The
patricians said at once: <span class="tei tei-q">“That is just the admission which
we wished to have from thy godless mouth. Nothing
more remains for thee but death.”</span> They then pronounced
his condemnation, and led him into the amphitheatre,
where his head was struck off. It was fastened
by the ears to the mile-stone, where it served the mob
three days for a spectacle. The body was dragged to
the Pelagium, a spot where the church of St. Pelagia
had stood, which the emperor had pulled down, to make
a court where the bodies of the condemned were thrown
after execution; in the same way as on the other side
the water he had pulled down St. Andrew's church to
make a place of execution. The body was also said to
have been dissected for the good of science.<a id="noteref_210" name="noteref_210" href="#note_210"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">210</span></span></a> This was
the reward which the patriarch received for having
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page409">[pg 409]</span><a name="Pg409" id="Pg409" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sacrificed his faith and conscience in giving sanction to
his master's impieties.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This degradation by Kopronymus of the man whom
he had made and called ecumenical patriarch, and to
make him had persisted in his father's overthrow of the
Church's order from the beginning, by an act of despotic
power breaking into her constitution, is it not also a
token of the condition into which the most ruthless
tyranny had reduced the episcopate of that eastern
realm? Those bishops who, at the bidding of an adventurer,
successful for the moment and presently swept
away, had met at Constantinople in 710 to overthrow
the Sixth Council and the faith of the Church; and
again, the three hundred and thirty-eight who had met
at the same place at the bidding of Kopronymus to make
the whole order of divine worship subject to his will, did
the spirit of St. Basil, St. Athanasius, St. Chrysostom,
St. Cyril of Alexandria live in them still, or were they in
possession indeed of unquestioned episcopal rank and all
the powers which belong to consecration, but in fact the
most abject minions of the most debased human will—the
will of a Byzantine despot? The will of one fined
already of one half his empire by the divine Hand
which raised up the most abject of savages to punish a
debased Christian realm. Yet ruler after ruler had not
received the lesson which faith derives from chastisement.
Leo III. surpassed his predecessors, and his son
surpassed the father, in imitating the arrogance of a
false theocracy. He carried his civil autocracy into
interference with the doctrine and the worship of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page410">[pg 410]</span><a name="Pg410" id="Pg410" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Church. This interference the laws of his own empire
warned him against, as cited by St. Gregory II. in the
examples of the greatest emperors.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not too much to say that the despotism wielded
by those who occupied the Byzantine throne from
Justinian to Kopronymus had eaten out the courage
and dulled the sense of divine things which we admire
in the Fathers of the fourth century. Athanasius
denounced a Constantius, and Basil a Valens, but the
eastern bishops of the eighth century crouched before
Leo and Kopronymus, and if there had not been a
succession of Popes, in whom the spirit of St. Leo lived
on, and the doctrine of St. Leo was maintained, the
Church herself would have yielded to the most debasing
despotism ever seen. But it must not be forgotten that
the bishops of the West were faithful to the teaching
and emulated the stedfastness of the Popes. A despotic
patriarch, nominee and instrument of a despotic
emperor, made a servile episcopate. A martyr Pope,
such as St. Martin, likewise made an army of martyrs.
The several character of bishops in the East and West
completes the contrast which we have been drawing
out.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the patriarch Constantine the ecumenical patriarchate
received its completed form. Kopronymus chose
him; took him by the hand, presented him to the 338
bishops who held an illicit and heretical council at his
bidding; having used him for his purposes, deposed,
beheaded him, treated his lifeless body with extreme
dishonour.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page411">[pg 411]</span><a name="Pg411" id="Pg411" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the same Kopronymus, the two hundred years of
secular lordship begun by Justinian's conquest of Rome
came to an end. He had disregarded the appeal of
Pope Stephen to defend his own dominion from the
Lombards. Pipin had deprived them of that dominion,
and then bestowed it upon St. Peter. Kopronymus asked
Pipin to give it back to him. Pipin refused, and after
thirty-four successive Popes had endured a dominion
which began with the deposition of St. Silverius by a
shameless woman, and perhaps cannot show a single act
of generous defence in return for loyal service during
two centuries, the attempt inaugurated by Justinian,
and finished by Kopronymus, to reduce the successor
of St. Peter to a patriarch whom they might treat as
the patriarch Constantine was treated, failed finally and
for ever. Stephen II., an infirm old man who had
crossed the Alps at the risk of his life, deserted by
Kopronymus and threatened by Aistulf, sat at the grave
of the chief Apostle, Prince as well as Bishop of Rome,
and the Christian faith was not left to be determined by
soldiers of fortune on the throne of Byzantium, but
saved by and for the guardianship of the living Peter.

From Metrophanes,<a id="noteref_211" name="noteref_211" href="#note_211"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">211</span></span></a> the first recorded bishop of
Byzantium, not yet Constantinople, in the time of the
Nicene Council to Methodius, in the year 842, when the
Iconoclast contest came to a final end, fifty-eight bishops
sat on the chair of the Greek capital. The first was
simple bishop of a suffragan city to the Thracian
metropolis of Heraclea. As soon as Constantine in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page412">[pg 412]</span><a name="Pg412" id="Pg412" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
year 330 had consecrated his new capital as Nova
Roma, there began a continual exaltation, the work of
the eastern emperors for their own purposes; after four
centuries the bishops of Constantinople had in 733
reached the culmination of their hopes by receiving
from the emperor Leo III. ten provinces out of the
Roman jurisdiction, and twenty bishoprics of his own
birth-land, Isauria, previously belonging to the patriarch
of Antioch. They were in a Greek sense ecumenical,
not because their authority extended over the world,
but because by imperial gift it had become conterminous
with that portion of the world which was considered by
the Greek emperor the habitation of men,<a id="noteref_212" name="noteref_212" href="#note_212"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">212</span></span></a> that is, his
subjects. The original and true patriarchates of Alexandria
and Antioch had fallen under Mohammedan
domination. So likewise had Jerusalem, which attained
patriarchal rank only in the middle of the fifth century.
The name of each as patriarch was carefully maintained,
especially for appearance in the list of Greek councils,
but in each case, and for hundreds of years, it was little
more than <span class="tei tei-q">“magni nominis umbra”</span>.<a id="noteref_213" name="noteref_213" href="#note_213"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">213</span></span></a> Of the fifty-eight
bishops of the capital many have gained for themselves
imperishable honour, many are venerated in the number
of the saints by Greeks and Latins, and looked up to as
intercessors and protectors, others have at least left
behind them in one or other respect a distinguished
memory. But more than a third, one and twenty, are
branded as heretics or favourers of heresy. Almost as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page413">[pg 413]</span><a name="Pg413" id="Pg413" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
many were for various reasons deposed, partly by
heretical, partly by orthodox emperors. Several, also,
of them received at the same time dishonouring treatment,
such as Kallinikus, Anastasius, and Constantine.
In three cases, those of St. Chrysostom, Eutychius, and
Pyrrhus, deposed prelates, were restored, a case which
much oftener recurs in later Byzantine history.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the fourth century the names of Eusebius, Macedonius,
Eudoxius, and Demophilus in the see of the
capital are marked as supporters of the Arian heresy.
In the fifth century the Nestorian heresy springs from
its author in the very chair of Constantinople. Fifty
years later the Acacian schism springs in like manner
from the ambition of its author in the same chair, and
the names of four successors, Fravitas, Euphemius, Macedonius
II, and Timotheus are struck from the diptychs
of their own church, when the schism was terminated
under Pope Hormisdas. In less than twenty years after
this, Anthimus, put into the see of the capital by the
intrigues of the same empress Theodora who violently
deposed Pope St. Silverius, was deposed by Pope Agapetus
in his visit to Constantinople, as a Monophysite
heretic. In the sixth century the Monothelite heresy
was owing mainly to the political intrigues of Sergius,
sitting for twenty-eight years in the see of Constantinople,
also the prime minister and guide of the emperor
Heraclius; he and his three successors, Pyrrhus, Paul,
and Peter, were the main-stay of that most insidious and
stubborn heresy, which for forty continuous years kept
the Church in peril, and strove to overthrow the efforts
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page414">[pg 414]</span><a name="Pg414" id="Pg414" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of ten Popes to maintain the faith, and brought one of
them to die a martyr under the rule of Constans II. But
in the seventh and eighth centuries, the most terrible
Iconoclast persecution found in six bishops of Constantinople
its main support, in that they put to the service
of the emperors Leo III. and Constantine Kopronymus,
Leo V. and Theophilus, these immense ecclesiastical
powers with which the emperors themselves had invested
them over the eastern bishops. The single patriarch had
himself become a despot in wielding the tyranny of the
civil despot as his chief instrument. These six ecumenical
patriarchs wielded their authority under Iconoclast
emperors for a long time: Anastasius I. from 730 to
753; Constantine II. from 754 to 766; Nicetas I.
from 766 to 780; then an orthodox sovereign brought
with him an orthodox council. The patriarch Tarasius
and union with the West might seem to have secured
a deliverance from a renewed reign of the Iconoclast
violence. On the contrary, three succeeding patriarchs,
Theodotus from 815 to 821; Antonius I. from 821 to
832, and John VII. from 832 to 841, did what they
could to carry out the wishes of their masters for that
heresy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such was the conduct, as guardian of the faith, of the
line of pseudo-popes set up by state policy at Constantinople,
in virtue of the pretension that the bishop of
Nova Roma should enjoy equal rights with the bishop of
Old Rome.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is to be noted that in this period the whole doctrine
concerning the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ went
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page415">[pg 415]</span><a name="Pg415" id="Pg415" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
through the most complete sifting and discussion in the
Councils of the Church. During it, from St. Silvester
to Gregory IV., seventy pontiffs sat in the chair of
Peter. They lived in full five hundred years of perpetual
struggle. One after another <span class="tei tei-q">“apparent diræ
facies inimicaque Troiæ numina”</span>—Arius in the foreground
heralding Mohammed in the rear; Nestorius
and Eutyches tearing the unity of the Church on
opposite sides; an able bishop of Constantinople seizing
the moment of Rome's temporal captivity under Arian
strangers to raise his see to parity: the East well nigh
devoured by opposing sects. After this, an insidious
Byzantine couple, Heraclius and Sergius, emperor and
patriarch, covering up deep wounds with ambiguous
words, and sacrificing the empire by their sacrifice of the
faith; and lastly, emperors who disregard things human
and divine, and mark their mastery over doctrine by
the subversion of worship, a Leo III. and a Constantine
Kopronymus. All secular power is in the hands
of Nova Roma which Constantine has set up to be the
Christian city from its cradle: the seven greater hills
to take the place of the hills by the Tiber, and in these
very hills of Constantine from age to age the evil vision
nestles—his successor and his patriarch are the chief
performers in this ever recruited drama of heresy. But
through all these attacks the seventy successors on St.
Peter's throne have kept the doctrine of the Church,
that is the doctrine of the Incarnation itself, one and
unchanged. The infidel has trampled upon Alexandria,
Antioch, and Jerusalem; but while the old Christendom
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page416">[pg 416]</span><a name="Pg416" id="Pg416" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
has sunk from debased nations into Saracen serfdom, a
new Christendom has arisen among Teuton settlers,
making their first steps in national life. Nova Roma
has been false to the purpose for which Constantine
founded it; and Old Rome has found among those whom
the rival counts as barbarians, one more faithful as well
as more powerful than she has been. Charlemagne
stands at the end of the vista which Constantine begins.
Of the two, does he not merit most in the Church of
God?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But to estimate at its due value this long series of
historic facts, it must be remembered that during at
least three centuries of this period, the seventy Popes
work as captives, the fifty-eight bishops of Constantinople
work as the right hand of emperors. From the
time indeed when St. Silvester passed from the catacombs
to the Lateran palace, to the time when the Vandal
robbers desolated Rome under the eyes of St.
Leo, the Popes were not captives. They had severe
persecution at times to undergo: especially under
Constantius I., the whole fifty years of Arian trial were a
special test of their fortitude, their clear undoubted
maintenance of the Godhead of our Lord, their unfaltering
trust in their apostolic right. But so long
as there was a Christian western emperor he had a
regard to the Apostolic See of the West: even a Valentinian
III. could acknowledge St. Leo in an imperial edict in
447 as <span class="tei tei-q">“Principem episcopalis coronæ”</span>; words which
present the very idea of St Peter's majesty, as the root,
the bond, and the crown of the episcopate. But with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page417">[pg 417]</span><a name="Pg417" id="Pg417" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the inroad of barbarians, as soldiers of fortune and civil
masters of Rome, another time begins. And when to
barbarous manners and brute force was added the Arian
spirit, a period ensued which was calculated to test to
the utmost the dowry of truth bestowed on the Apostolic
See. Justinian as a civil ruler may be deemed worse
than Odoacer, worse even than Theodorich. What the
Popes did, they did often after being nominated without
free election, often with the postponement of their confirmation
after election (as when after the death of Pope
Honorius, Pope Severinus had his three years diminished
to two months, in the hope of Heraclius to bend him to
the Monothelite heresy), sometimes with unjust depositions,
as St. Silverius by Theodora, as St. Martin by
Constans II., as St. Sergius attempted by Justinian II.,
as John VI. attempted by Apsimar, the emperor of a
day: again by unlawful substitution for a living Pope,
as Eugenius to St. Martin, when condemned but not yet
martyred. Then again the eleven years preceding the
great Pope Sergius from 676 to 687 witness the appointment
of six Popes. At this time there is a series of
Popes who show eastern lineage, as if the emperor's
hand were busy in the choice of them. But no one of
them fails, and St. Sergius and St. Gregory III., both
easterns, are of the very greatest and most stedfast in
the whole time of Popes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Add to this that the civil condition of these Popes,
from the entrance of the Lombards to the end of the
exarchs, was often most perilous. It was plaintively
alluded to by St. Agatho in addressing the Sixth Council,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page418">[pg 418]</span><a name="Pg418" id="Pg418" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
when forty years after the death of Honorius he set forth
in most absolute language the unfaltering integrity of
faith which had marked the Apostolic See to his own
time, language; which the Council accepted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is to be noted that a Pope, whose election had
been long delayed by the mere arbitrary will of
emperor or exarch, as soon as he was consecrated, entered
into the full possession of his unrestricted rights. The
exarch who had power to delay, who had power to
plunder the Lateran treasury of the Church, as Isaac
and John Platina did, had no power to lessen the
dignity of St. Peter's succession when once acknowledged.
Even Vigilius is admitted to have emancipated himself
from the thraldom of Theodora; and Eugenius, forced
upon the Romans by the tyranny of Constans II.,
was a blameless Pope, who did not yield to the heresy
of Constans.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What manner of men were they who were loyal vassals
to the most iniquitous rulers, and when solicited by their
own faithful peoples to break an abhorred yoke yet held
them back, and adhered to those who gave them neither
protection nor justice? They did not rule as Satraps
in a kingdom worn down to prostration by centuries of
arbitrary power, but were acknowledged as sitting in
the apostolic throne of Faith and Justice by rough lords
from the North, to whom obedience in spiritual things
was a Christian virtue learned with great difficulty by
those who inherited a natural independence. Interminable
intestine quarrels among the western potentates,
who yet accept the voice of an unarmed Pope as the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page419">[pg 419]</span><a name="Pg419" id="Pg419" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
interpreter of faith, and the most upright arbiter of
human justice, are a proof the more how deeply the rule
of St. Peter had sunk into the western mind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What guarantee of truth can be offered by the course
of human things if this be not one? That is the
testimony of the three centuries from Genseric the
Vandal to Aistulf the Lombard. The testimony of
Teuton conquerors, who burn what they once worshipped,
and worship what they once burnt, who enter on their
dominion as spoilers and develop into Christian monarchs.
The testimony of Constantine's imperial successors, who
own the papal succession to St. Peter, while they try to
bend it to their will, and in the attempt subject half
their empire to an anti-Christian tyranny. Lastly, the
testimony of St. Leo the Great and fifty-one successors
to the time when St. Leo III., invested with civil
sovereignty, employed the acknowledged greatness of
his spiritual power to restore the empire which the
first Leo saw sinking in ruins.

The munificence thus begun in his gratitude by
Constantine was continued during centuries by great
Roman families and by others also. The pastoral staff
fixed itself in Roman earth, and became a great tree. In
due time it flowered in a prince's sceptre. It is most
interesting to mark in the gifts to the Roman See the
heathen names of ancient patrician families commemorated.

A fact<a id="noteref_215" name="noteref_215" href="#note_215"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">215</span></span></a> which enters deep into the world's history bears
remarkable witness to the rapid increase of papal wealth
and its inevitable accompaniment, the political independence
of St. Peter's chair. From the time the unity of the
Roman realm began to be dissolved into two empires,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page422">[pg 422]</span><a name="Pg422" id="Pg422" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the eastern and the western, not a single western ruler
fixed his seat abidingly in Rome, although almost all
lived in Italy, and although many of them could have
put to good use, amid the State's increasing weakness,
the help which the charm of the Roman name offered.
After the death of Constantine the Great in 337, of his
three sons Constantius I. received the East, Constans I.
received the West in union with his younger brother
Constantine II., but after his murder, alone. This
Constans usually dwelt in Gaul. When he visited Italy
we find him prefer Milan and Aquileia to Rome. He
yielded to the insurgent Maxentius, and then Constantius
became sole master of the realm, and, when in the West,
lived chiefly in Milan. In his whole reign once only
did he enter Rome.<a id="noteref_216" name="noteref_216" href="#note_216"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">216</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second division of the realm, which followed the
emperor Jovian, gave Valentinian for ruler of the West,
who selected at first Milan for residence, but was compelled
by incursions of the German peoples to spend
much time on the Rhine. We learn, partly from the
history of St. Ambrose, partly from other documents,
that the sons and successors of Valentinian I., Gratian,
and Valentinian II., as well as the mother and guardian
of the latter, the widowed empress Justina, when in
Italy held their court chiefly at Milan and Aquileia.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The third and final partition, which severed the West
for ever from the East, took place in 395 after the death

taken for his partner. From that time not Rome, not

Milan, or Aquileia, but the seaport Ravenna appears the
permanent residence of those phantom-emperors who
ruled for nearly a century until the full dissolution of
the western empire. The political significance of the
last city even remarkably survived the name of the
Roman empire.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We are expressly told that Odoacer, the first German
king of Italy, who deposed Romulus Augustulus, the
last West Roman, had his seat in Ravenna. The same
was the case with Odoacer's conqueror, the great Ostrogoth,
Theodorich. During his government Ravenna
received the title of the royal city, though the Ostrogoth
often lived in other great cities of upper Italy, such as
Pavia and Verona. Finally Ravenna, after the extinction
of the Ostrogothic state and people, remained for nearly
two hundred years the seat of the exarchs, Byzantine
viceroys of Italy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Why of so many princes bearing the title of Roman
emperors or kings of Italy did no single one make his
seat in the former capital of the world? Why did the
greater number pay it only a transitory visit, some
perhaps not see it at all? I think only one sufficient
answer can be given to this question. They shunned
a longer stay at Rome because they felt that in a city
which had assumed a priestly character they would no
longer play the first part so much as kings desire and
must desire it. That fact is, therefore, an incontestable
proof not only of the papal power, but likewise of its
wealth. Without property no co-active force, not even
spiritual, can in the long run maintain itself.

property from any testator, had results so
astonishingly great, that in 50 years Valentinian I.
thought it necessary to put a limit on it. We may pass
at once to the time of St. Gregory the Great, the fourteen
years 590 to 604. At that time the Bishop of
Rome in his Lateran Palace, had become the greatest
ground landlord in Italy, and even in all the West. He
was the real protector of Rome. The eastern emperor
bore the name, but in every need and trial it was not
at Ravenna or at Constantinople that help was sought,
but at the Lateran. Royal dignity waited already upon
the Vicar of Christ; a dignity with which the spontaneous
offerings of three hundred years had invested him.
St. Gregory lived like a monk, and gave away as a king
from the inexhaustible fountain of the apostolic charity.

His letters enable us to form a fair estimate of the
domains of the Roman Church at that time. In his
unresting activity to minister aright the material wealth
of the Church, the son of St. Benedict ripened the
recognition of his political independence. His death
preceded by 150 years the legal acknowledgment of
sovereignty attained by his successor, Stephen II., and
that intervening period was, as we have seen, a time of
exceedingly severe trial. A notice of the deacon John,
biographer of St. Gregory, informs us that in his
pontificate the Roman Church possessed at least twenty-three
patrimonies. These were respectively, that of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page425">[pg 425]</span><a name="Pg425" id="Pg425" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Sicily, of Syracuse, of Palermo, of Calabria, of Apulia,
the Samnite, the Neapolitan, the Campanian, the
Tuscan, the Sabine, the Nursian, the Carseolan, that of
Via Appia, of Ravenna, of Illyricum, the Istrian, Dalmatian,
Sardinian, Corsican, Ligurian, that of the
Cottian Alps, of Germanicia, and of Gaul.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The position of the Popes from the time of St.

<span class="tei tei-q">“The Popes were usually the helpers out of every need.
They supplied the money required for the payment of
the troops, and for the requisite provisionment, to keep
off the ever-impending threatenings of scarcity. They
also frequently redeemed captives. Now as the Protector
always exercised a decisive influence on the protected,
and the distant emperors distinguished themselves as
much by their neglect, as the Vicars of Christ by their
activity in the interest of Italy, and especially of the
seven-hilled city, nothing was more natural than that
the estimation of those who were so often its preservers
advanced more and more. Thus they soon came in fact
to stand at the head of almost all secular matters in and
about Rome, with almost sovereign power. That was
especially the case since the pontificate of the great
Gregory I., a Pope truly venerable both for his very
distinguished mental gifts, and for his far-stretching,
sound, practical discernment, and his inflexible will.

of 1360 square miles, that is 870,400 acres, in the
time of Leo the Isaurian, and that these lands produced
to them 200,000 gold soldi in money, and 500,000 in
kind. And if we add to this computation the very
great secular powers which the policy of Justinian had
placed throughout his empire in the hands of the
bishops, we may form some notion of the secular
authority wielded by the Popes before they obtained
the technical rank of sovereigns, according to modern
definition of that word. Constantine's gift of the Lateran
palace may be considered the starting point which the
continual generosity of so many succeeding generations
extended, as has been recounted, until the unanimous
voice of his people, delivered, as they hoped, from the
Lombard burden, saluted Stephen II. on his return in

Under the year 752, when Aistulf had attacked the
exarchate and occupied the city of Ravenna, and was
turning his arms against the Roman duchy and the
cities depending on it, Muratori writes: <span class="tei tei-q">“From what
we have hitherto seen, although the Greek emperors had
their ministers in Rome, yet the principal authority of
government seems to have been seated in the Roman
Pontiffs. They with the power and majesty of their
rank and with the accompaniment of their virtues
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page427">[pg 427]</span><a name="Pg427" id="Pg427" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
tranquilly governed that city and duchy, defending it
moreover vigorously, when need arose, from the claws of
the Lombards.”</span><a id="noteref_220" name="noteref_220" href="#note_220"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">220</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such was the position of the Pontiffs before that
definitive rejection of the Byzantine sovereign made by
Stephen II. when he was left naked to the assault of
Aistulf by the cowardice or the impotence of Constantine
Kopronymus. From his return in 756 he and his
successors after him became kings as well as Popes of
Rome. Scrupulous as the two Gregories, Zacharias and
Stephen himself had been up to the time of the compact
with Pipin, never after did any Pope acknowledge the
Byzantine as his civil sovereign.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Never could an Italian of those ages have given to the
Goth or the Lombard that heartfelt devotion which they
felt for the perpetual defender of the Italian people, who
was seated in the centre of Italy at once the champion
of the Christian faith, and representative of Rome's old
Commonwealth. The Byzantine slave-master revolted
the Roman heart; the Arian politician revolted the
Christian faith: but in the Roman see St. Sergius the
Syrian emulated the courage of St. Martin the Roman,
and St. Gregory III., also Syrian, was in no quality behind
his predecessor St. Gregory II. the Roman. Is it any
wonder that by the end of the seventh century when a
Justinian II. tried to repeat on the person of St. Sergius
the wickedness practised by his grandfather upon St.
Martin, his own soldiers rose against the guardsman
whom he had deputed to this atrocious work, and recognized
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page428">[pg 428]</span><a name="Pg428" id="Pg428" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the Pope the defender of all which they
held dear, whether in the natural or the supernatural
life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And, again, had not the seven revolutions at Byzantium—ending
in the exultation of a rough soldier who
was able in the field, but ignorant in doctrine—given a
sufficient lesson to the Italian peoples to cast off a force
which disregarded all right in the natural order, and the
whole tradition of faith in the supernatural realm of
revealed truth?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

I will here insert the judgment of another historian,
upon the gift of the exarchate, made by Pipin to St.
Peter, in the person of the Popes:—<a id="noteref_221" name="noteref_221" href="#note_221"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">221</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“To question the
rightness of this donation is unreasonable and preposterous.
Since the reconquest of Italy by Belisarius
and Narses, Rome was regarded at Constantinople
simply as a province, not as a member of the realm, or
not as, what it had originally been, the seat of empire.
On what could the right of Greek tyrants be founded
constantly to receive back, even at second hand, conquests
which they were able neither to govern nor to
maintain? The assertions of some late historical writers
seem to pre-suppose that all Europe, as far as the Rhine
and the Danube, were placed by God for ever under the
Byzantine yoke, and that the shaking off this yoke was
an unpardonable injustice. Rome did under her
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page429">[pg 429]</span><a name="Pg429" id="Pg429" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
bishops what peoples did under their kings. Rome
took her opportunity to free herself from the yoke of
foreign dominion and unnatural relations. No prince,
no people of Europe has any other claim upon its soil
to show than this and the centuries. Both tell for
Rome. Before this testimony, the lesser but yet valid
right disappears, that the Greek emperor had confiscated
the Papal possessions situated in Lower Italy, and that
nothing was more natural than that it should take the
compensation which presented itself. The other question
which has been also proposed, whether the office of
a teacher and bishop of the Christian community can
be united with a secular administration, had been long
before answered. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Rome owed its actual existence
solely to the protection of its bishops.</span></em> They had found
their best right of sovereignty in the gratitude of the
people, and long before the donation of Ravenna, they
had been, if not in name, yet in fact, princes in Rome.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the beginning of the year 756, Aistulf, the most
aggressive of Lombard kings, had strictly invested
Rome, ravaged its campagna, and destroyed the churches
therein, while he devoutly exhumed the bodies of
martyrs to transport them to new shrines in Pavia.
In the spring of that year he surrendered his capital to
the king of the Franks, and submitted to all the conditions
imposed on him by Pipin. In the autumn, by a
sudden stroke of God, he died out hunting. At the beginning
of the year 757, Desiderius, by the help of the
Pope, Stephen II. had succeeded to the Lombard throne,
itself spared by Pipin, and these great changes are recorded
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page430">[pg 430]</span><a name="Pg430" id="Pg430" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in an extant letter of Pope Stephen, a hymn of
gratitude and praise, to Pipin, who had placed the keys
of the recovered cities, forming the new created State of
the Church, on the tomb of St. Peter. Great is the
contrast between the letters of 756, written to Pipin, in
the height of Rome's distress and danger, and this letter
from the first Pope-king to his benefactor.

A few days after this letter, that is, on the 24th
April, 757, Stephen II. closed in peace his course on
earth. He died in the Lateran patriarchal palace, acknowledged
by all as king of Rome: and attended by
his brother, Paul, who was to be his successor. He was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page432">[pg 432]</span><a name="Pg432" id="Pg432" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
buried with extraordinary honours in St. Peter's. In
his short pontificate of five years he set the crown upon
the work of his three great predecessors, Gregory II.,
Gregory III., and Zacharias, and is counted among the
most illustrious of the Popes. He closed the seven
centuries of Popes who were subjects: he opens the eleven
centuries of Popes who have been kings. From the
Pope who was crucified on the Roman hill to the Pope
who died a king in the patriarchal Lateran palace, 93
in number, enemies have tried to deface the memory of
two—but the voice of impartial history regards those
rulers of the Church with unalloyed gratitude as men
who, through trials and difficulties unsurpassed, kept
the faith of the Church inviolate. That the city of
Rome existed in their day, and exists now, is due to
the pastoral staff of St. Peter, planted in its soil, which
became, in the hand of Stephen II., the most gracious,
the most prolific, the most honoured of sceptres.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Stephen II. was succeeded immediately by his brother
Paul, who had been the chosen companion of his
counsels and anxieties during the severe trials of his
pontificate, ending so gloriously. It was the first
instance of a brother to the Pope succeeding to his
chair. He had been brought up, like his brother Stephen,
in the Lateran patriarchal palace from the time of St.
Gregory II., and was made a cardinal deacon by Pope
Zacharias. <span class="tei tei-q">“He was meek and very merciful, never
rendering evil for evil to anyone.”</span><a id="noteref_223" name="noteref_223" href="#note_223"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">223</span></span></a>
He sat from 757 to
767, ten years and a month. During the whole time the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page433">[pg 433]</span><a name="Pg433" id="Pg433" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
closest union was maintained between the Holy See and
King Pipin. A series of letters from the Pope to the
king is extant, testifying the affection and the confidence
which existed between them. It was by the influence
of Pope Stephen II. that the new king of the Lombards,
Desiderius, was accepted by that people after the untimely
death of King Aistulf. He bound himself strictly to
carry out the compact at Pavia between the Franks, the
Lombards, and the Romans, in virtue of which, at the
subjection of King Aistulf to Pipin, the Lombard
monarchy continued to exist. The reign of Desiderius
from 757 until he was finally overthrown and deposed
by Charles in 774 shows a repetition of attempts by
fraud or by violence to evade the conditions which he
had bound himself to accept. Already, in 757, Pope Paul
I. wrote to King Pipin: <span class="tei tei-q">“We<a id="noteref_224" name="noteref_224" href="#note_224"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">224</span></span></a> make known to your
Excellence that we have hitherto received nothing of
those things which by our legates we committed to your
charge, for, according to their wont, those perfidious and
malignant Lombards, persisting in great arrogance of
heart, are by no means inclined to restore the justice of
St. Peter”</span>. The possession of the cities and territories
of Imola, Bologna, Osimo, Ancona, and Umana were in
question. In the next year, 758, Desiderius ravaged
with fire and sword the Pentapolis. Then he attacked
the duchies of Spoleto and Benevento, which had put
themselves under the protection of the Pope and the
king of the Franks.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At another time the Greek emperor Kopronymus was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page434">[pg 434]</span><a name="Pg434" id="Pg434" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
bent upon recovering Ravenna and the Pentapolis, and
upon attacking Rome itself. Desiderius met his agent
and wrote to the emperor, exhorting him to send an
army into Italy, and promising that he with all his
Lombards would help him to recover Ravenna, and whatever
else he desired.<a id="noteref_225" name="noteref_225" href="#note_225"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">225</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Through the whole ten years of Paul's pontificate, this
king Pipin discharged with fidelity his office of Roman
Patricius, that is, the sworn defender of the Holy See.
It was this protection alone which enabled the Pope to
maintain his newly founded State against the perpetual
wiles of the Lombard, as well as against the Greek
enmity. As to Kopronymus, the Iconoclastic heresy
was the furious passion of his whole life. Pope Paul
wrote to King Pipin:<a id="noteref_226" name="noteref_226" href="#note_226"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">226</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“You know well how those most
nefarious Greeks pursue us only to destroy and tread
under foot the orthodox faith and the tradition of the
fathers”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When Pope Paul I. died, in 767, his pontificate of ten
years had been throughout agitated by the perpetual
oscillations of king Desiderius, alternating acts of
devotion with acts of hostility, promises with violations of them, restitution
of rights with fresh acts of plundering.<a id="noteref_227" name="noteref_227" href="#note_227"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">227</span></span></a>
Scarcely had Paul I. closed his eyes when the
duke Toto, a very powerful baron of the Roman Tuscany,
conspired with his three brothers, Constantine, Passivus, and Paschalis,
to get possession of Rome and the papacy.<a id="noteref_228" name="noteref_228" href="#note_228"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">228</span></span></a>
Toto and his party, while preparation was being made
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page435">[pg 435]</span><a name="Pg435" id="Pg435" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for the solemn obsequies of Paul I. and the due election
of his successor, broke into Rome, suddenly elected his
brother Constantine, a layman, introduced him by
violence into the Lateran palace. He seized upon
George, bishop of Palestrina, and compelled him to confer
minor orders upon Constantine. The next day he was
made deacon by the same bishop, and on the following
Sunday Toto, attended by a large body of armed men,
carried the intruded Constantine to St. Peter's, where
the three suburbican bishops, the said George of
Palestrina, and the bishops of Albano and Porto, gave him
episcopal consecration. In such fashion Constantine
seated himself in the chair of Peter; he forced the people
to make oath of fidelity to him. Thus the layman of a
week before, thrust upon the clergy and people of Rome
by the rudest violence, held possession of the Apostolic
See for thirteen months. He wrote lying letters to
King Pipin, who was not deceived by them. But Rome
was filled with conspiracy and unrule.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A year after this event, in July, 768 the intruder
Constantine was deposed, his brother Toto killed, while a
second pretended Pope, named Philip, set up for the
moment, was driven away. By the exertions of Christophorus,
first of the seven Palatine judges, and his son
Sergius, Stephen III., a Sicilian, and at the time cardinal
priest of St. Cecilia, was duly elected Pope. He sat during
three years and six months, in the course of which great
events took place. His first act was to send Sergius to
King Pipin and his sons, beseeching him to depute a
number of Frankish bishops to Rome to hold a council
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page436">[pg 436]</span><a name="Pg436" id="Pg436" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
there with him, and to make regulations which might
prevent the recurrence of violence so deplorable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Sergius found king Pipin dying. He expired at St.
Denys on the 24th September, 768. There he was
buried and afterwards his monument bore the inscription,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Pipin, the king, father of Charles the Great”</span>. He left
his states, with the consent of the nobles and bishops,
between his sons Charles and Carloman, who were
crowned and anointed on the same day, 9th October,
768, Charles at Noyon, Carloman at Soissons. Pipin
died aged fifty-five, having ruled France for twenty-seven
years, ten as Mayor of the palace, seventeen
as king of the Franks.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The legate Sergius proceeded at once to the kings,
Charles and Carloman. They granted all which he
desired. They gave him twelve Frankish bishops well
instructed in the scriptures and the holy canons, the
archbishop of Sens, the bishops of Mainz, Tours, Lyons,
Bourges, Narbonne, Rheims, Langres, Noyon, Worms,
and two others with sees of names unknown. These
bishops came to Rome in April, 769, and Pope Stephen
III. assembled bishops from Tuscany, Campania, and the
rest of Italy, and held a council in the Lateran Basilica.
Among other decrees they passed one under anathema:
<span class="tei tei-q">“that no laymen, nor any one save a cardinal, deacon
or priest, ascending through the distinct degrees, be promoted to the honour
of the sacred pontificate”</span>.<a id="noteref_229" name="noteref_229" href="#note_229"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">229</span></span></a> The
Pope, all the priests, and the Roman people, prostrate
on the pavement, deplored the sin they had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page437">[pg 437]</span><a name="Pg437" id="Pg437" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
committed in receiving Communion from the unhappy
intruder, Constantine, who had been deprived of sight
during the wild struggle which attended his deposition,
and now in most abject guise confessed his crime before
the council, and was condemned to penance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this terrible outburst of ambition and crime, which
showed but too clearly to what sudden dangers Rome was
exposed, the two great officers, Christophorus, the first
of the seven Palatine judges, and his son Sergius, had
done their utmost to prevent the usurpation, and in the
end delivered the Holy See from the intruder Constantine.
Desiderius had taken no part in the intrusion of the
anti-pope. He even assisted Christophorus and Sergius
in removing him. But in doing this a Lombard priest,
Waldepert, sought to set up another anti-pope, and lost
his life. After the due appointment of Stephen III., the
master stroke of the Lombard king's policy was to sever,
if he could, the two Frank kings from friendship with
the Holy See, and so sooner or later to get possession of
Rome. He proposed in 770 a double marriage; on one
side the marriage of his daughter Desiderata or Ermengarde
either with Charles or with Carloman; on the
other that of their sister, the princess Gisela, with his
son Adelchis. The queen mother, Bertrada, set her
hand to accomplish the first. There is a most earnest
letter from Pope Stephen III. to the kings Charles and
Carloman, entreating them not to stain the noble Frank
race, the most eminent of all, by a connection with the
faithless and perfidious Lombard. <span class="tei tei-q">“You have likewise,”</span>
he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“by the will of God, and the command
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page438">[pg 438]</span><a name="Pg438" id="Pg438" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of your father, contracted lawful marriages with
excellent royal ladies out of your own people, conspicuous
for their nobility and beauty. It is not lawful for
you to repudiate them. To take other wives would be
an impiety. Heathens only can so act. Forget not, most
illustrious sons, that you received holy unction from St.
Peter's successor, that your father of glorious memory
listened to the injunctions of our predecessor Stephen,
and forebore to separate from your mother, Bertrada,
and be mindful of your repeated promise to St. Peter and
his successor that you would ever be friends of our friends
and enemies of our enemies. Would you now bind
yourselves to our enemies? For the faithless people of
the Lombards, which ceases not to attack the Church of
God, and make incursions on our province of Rome, is
our manifest enemy.”</span><a id="noteref_230" name="noteref_230" href="#note_230"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">230</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nevertheless the queen mother, Bertrada, carried out
her design, and the king Desiderius seemed to attain the
summit of security, so far at least as this, that though
his son Adelchis did not obtain the princess Gisela,
Charles took his daughter Ermengarde. He also sent
her back to her father the next year, and his friend and
secretary, Eginhard, has left unexplained the cause of
this repudiation. No historian has thrown light upon
this particular in the history of Charles, either how he
came to brave the anathema of Pope Stephen III. by
deserting a lawful wife, or how he came to send back
in a year the unhappy princess whom he had unlawfully
taken, or how we find Hildegarde acknowledged as his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page439">[pg 439]</span><a name="Pg439" id="Pg439" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
lawful wife from 771 to her death in 786. The blot
remains unerased upon the memory of him who was
otherwise the greatest of the Christian emperors.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With the marriage—if it is to be so called—of his
daughter with Charles, Desiderius seemed to have
reached well nigh the end of his ambition. Christophorus
and his son Sergius had put an end to the
usurpation of Constantine, were the heads of the
national Roman party,<a id="noteref_231" name="noteref_231" href="#note_231"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">231</span></span></a>
and the soul of Pope Stephen
III.'s government. Desiderius in a visit to Rome
managed to set the Pope against them. He had a
Lombard party there, at the head of which was a certain
Paul Afiarta, high in the Pope's service. Christophorus
and his son Sergius both lost their lives. They
had urged the king of the Lombards to restore to the
Holy See the rights which he kept back. Desiderius was
infuriated by their conduct<a id="noteref_232" name="noteref_232" href="#note_232"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">232</span></span></a> and strove to destroy them.<a id="noteref_233" name="noteref_233" href="#note_233"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">233</span></span></a>
Desiderius was encamped outside of St. Peter's. A
company of Lombard soldiers dragged the two victims,
who had been taken out of St. Peter's, to the gate of
the city, at the bridge: tore out their eyes, of which
outrage Christophorus died in three days: Sergius survived
in prison during two years, that is, to the death of
Pope Stephen, when he was most atrociously murdered
by order of Paul Afiarta.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But now the whole course of history was altered by a
death which occurred on the 4th December. Carloman
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page440">[pg 440]</span><a name="Pg440" id="Pg440" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
died in the flower of his youth, leaving behind him two
very young children by his wife Gilberga. Charles was
called by the unanimous vote of the Frank magnates to
rule the whole kingdom of the Franks increased greatly
as it was by the late conquests of Charles in Aquitania
and Gascony. Two months later, 1st February, 772,
Stephen III. closed his pontificate of three years and a
half. The Pope before his death had discovered how
grievously he had been deceived by king Desiderius, to
whom his two chief servants and ministers had been
sacrificed. Desiderius kept none of the promises which
he had made on the occasion of his coming to Rome:
and when the Pope reminded him of them by a special
embassy, mockingly replied:<a id="noteref_234" name="noteref_234" href="#note_234"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">234</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“The Holy Father Stephen
might have been contented that I delivered him from
his two tyrants Christophorus and Sergius, and did not
need to demand the rights of St. Peter. If I had not
helped the Holy Father, great ruin would have fallen
upon him, since Carloman, king of the Franks, the friend
of both, was ready to bring an army to Rome to avenge
their death, and carry away the Pope captive.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The repudiation of his daughter, Ermengarde, and
the rupture of the desired alliance between Desiderius
and Charles, terminated the good fortune of the Lombard
king. From that time he seemed to lose his
vigour of mind, and political insight. He continued to
pursue, without check, the design of Aistulf, which he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page441">[pg 441]</span><a name="Pg441" id="Pg441" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had now fully made his own, to become master of
Rome. But he had to deal with other adversaries.
Eight days after the death of Pope Stephen III., he
was succeeded by one of the greatest pontiffs who ever
sat on the throne of St. Peter. Adrian, the son of
Theodorus, was born in Rome of a very noble family,
one of the most powerful in the city. Losing his
parents early, he was brought up by a relation named
Theodotus, Primicerius of the Roman See. He was
distinguished from his youth by his purity of life, and
his singular personal beauty. Pope Paul I. had placed
him among the clergy, Pope Stephen III. created him a
cardinal deacon, in which office his zeal, eloquence,
learning, and management of affairs endeared him to
the Roman people. On the very day of the Pope
Stephen's death he was proclaimed unanimously his
successor, and in eight days consecrated. He showed at
once the vigour of mind and promptitude of execution
which rendered his reign illustrious, and it continued
nearly to twenty-four years, a period which no Pontiff
reached in the seven hundred years from St. Peter
before him, nor in the thousand years after him, until,
at the end of the eighteenth century, it was slightly
passed by that Pontiff who died a confessor, exiled, persecuted,
and forlorn at Valence, in that land of the Franks,
with whose greatest king Pope Adrian was bound in
the closest personal friendship.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No sooner was Pope Adrian seated than he struck
down that Lombard faction which the gold and intrigues
of Desiderius had planted at Rome. Its head was Paul
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page442">[pg 442]</span><a name="Pg442" id="Pg442" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Afiarta. In the very last days of Pope Stephen, he had
caused the blinded Sergius to be assassinated, and
banished from Rome certain judges, both of the clergy
and the army, that he might have more weight in the
forthcoming election. Adrian, the moment that he was
elected, recalled the judges, and delivered from prison
those who had been confined for the like reason. Desiderius,
who desired to keep up appearances with him,
sent him a solemn embassy of the three principal persons
in his kingdom, Theodicius, duke of Spoleto,
Tunno, duke of Ivrea, and the Lord Treasurer Prandulus.
Their office was to profess friendship and alliance
to the new Pope. Adrian replied:<a id="noteref_235" name="noteref_235" href="#note_235"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">235</span></span></a>—<span class="tei tei-q">“It is my desire
to have peace with all Christians, and even with your
king, Desiderius, I will study to remain in that compact
which was made between the Romans, the Franks, and
the Lombards. But how can I trust your king in the
matter in which my predecessor, Stephen, of holy
memory, has spoken to me fully of his want of good
faith: how he falsified everything which he promised
on oath over the body of St. Peter, for the rights of holy
Church, and only by his own hostile pleading, caused
the eyes of Christophorus and Sergius to be put out, and
worked out his own will upon those two chief men of the
Church. Such is the faith of your king, Desiderius,
and how can I trust in a treaty with him?”</span> In reply,
the ambassadors made oath that Desiderius would fulfil
what he had promised to Pope Stephen, and broken.
The Pope thereupon despatched messengers to see that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page443">[pg 443]</span><a name="Pg443" id="Pg443" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Desiderius fulfilled the promise. When these reached
Perugia, they found that Desiderius had already taken
the city of Faenza, and the duchy of Ferrara, and was
pressing Ravenna with siege. It was only two months
after the accession of Pope Adrian, and presently
messengers from Ravenna came supplicating his help,
just as thirty years before, when pressed by the arms of
Liutprand, they had recourse to Pope Zacharias. But
now the exarchate was fully subject to the Pope, and
called upon him as part of his own State for defence.
When this conduct of Desiderius was reported to the
Pope, he wrote in the gravest terms to the Lombard
king, requiring him to restore the cities, and upbraiding
him with the breach of those very promises which his
own ambassadors had just made in his name. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
king,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“had taken cities which his predecessors,
Stephen II., Paul I., and Stephen III., had possessed.”</span>
Desiderius returned, for answer, <span class="tei tei-q">“that he would not
restore those cities, unless he first met the Pope”</span>. At
the same time, he had received the widow and young
children of the deceased Carloman, and wanted to induce
the Pope to crown them, and so create division in
the Frank empire, and alienate Charles, the Patricius
of Rome, from the Pope, and thus subjugate the city of
Rome and all Italy to the Lombard kingdom.<a id="noteref_236" name="noteref_236" href="#note_236"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">236</span></span></a> But
Adrian stood firm as adamant. One of his two legates
to the king, Paul Afiarta, was in league with the king,
and promised to bring the Pope before him, even if it
were with a rope round him. But, at this very moment,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page444">[pg 444]</span><a name="Pg444" id="Pg444" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the body of the murdered Sergius was discovered at
Rome. The Pope ordered an inquiry into the circumstances
of his death. At the earnest entreaty of the
Palatine judges, among whom Sergius had been second
in rank, and of the whole Roman people, the Pope
ordered the prefect of the city to try for homicide
the parties inculpated. The crime was brought
home to the legate, Paul Afiarta himself, at whose
suggestion other highly placed officers had taken
the blind Sergius out of prison, and pierced him with
wounds. The Pope ordered the bodies of Christophorus
and Sergius to be taken up and honourably buried in
St. Peter's. He sent the Acts of the Court to the archbishop
of Ravenna, instructing him to detain Paul
Afiarta, when he returned from his embassy to the
Lombard king. Archbishop Leo went beyond the
Pope's instructions: handed over Paul Afiarta to the
chief judge of Ravenna, before whom he acknowledged
his guilt: and, instead of sending the criminal, as the
Pope ordered, in exile to the East, had him executed by
the judge.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Desiderius found himself bereft of his counsellor, Paul
Afiarta: he refused to listen to the Pope's request to
restore his cities. He committed further outrages and
assaults. He rejected repeated letters and messengers
of the Pope. His reply was that, instead of restoring
cities, he would march with his whole army to Rome,
and force it to surrender. The Pope had several of the
gates of Rome built up and others carefully closed, and
sent by sea messengers to Charles, begging him to help
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page445">[pg 445]</span><a name="Pg445" id="Pg445" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Roman Church as his father had done, and force
Desiderius to restore what he had taken from St. Peter.<a id="noteref_237" name="noteref_237" href="#note_237"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">237</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Desiderius saw that his attempt to move the Pope
to crown the sons of Carloman was vain; then, with the
widowed Gilberga, these sons and the duke, Autchar, he
advanced his troops from Pavia, on the way to Rome,
and informed the Pope of it. Adrian replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“If the
king does not give up the cities, as he has promised,
and fully satisfy us, it is useless for him to take the
trouble to come to us. He shall not see my face.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Adrian, while awaiting the succour which he had asked
from king Charles, had taken all measures necessary
for the defence of Rome. He collected all the men of
war whom he could from the Roman Tuscany, from
Campania, from the duchy of Perugia, from such cities
of the Pentapolis as the Lombards had not yet taken,
who, with the Roman soldiers, might suffice to defend
the vast circle of the walls and towers, and sustain a
siege at least for a time. The two basilicas of St. Peter
and St. Paul, being outside the walls, were defenceless.
The Pope caused them to be stripped of all precious
objects, which were brought for protection within the
city. He had all the doors closed and barred up within:
so that, if the Lombard king attempted an entrance, it
would be as a burglar.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These were his acts as a sovereign prince—as pontiff,
learning that the king was approaching the Roman
frontiers, he sent to him the bishops of Albano, Palestrina,
and Tibur, with an intimation in his own hand,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page446">[pg 446]</span><a name="Pg446" id="Pg446" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
adjuring him by all the divine mysteries, and under
threat of excommunication, that neither he, nor any
Lombard, nor the Frank Autchar should set foot on
the Roman territory without his leave.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Desiderius had reached Viterbo, the last city of the
Lombard Tuscany. He was, at the head of his army,
about to pass the frontier. On receiving the Pope's
injunction he was struck with confusion and retired
back with his army to his own city, Pavia. As the
Hun had listened to St. Leo, the Lombard also listened
to Adrian, and Rome was once more saved by her
pontiff.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When Peter,<a id="noteref_238" name="noteref_238" href="#note_238"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">238</span></span></a>
the legate of Adrian, reached France in
the first months of 773, he found Charles wintering at
Thionville, after his first expedition against the Saxons.
He had destroyed the famous idol Irminoul. It was
the beginning of his longest and fiercest war. Now,
Pope Adrian called upon him, as Patricius of the
Romans, to defend Rome and the State of St. Peter
against Desiderius, from whom neither peace nor justice
could any longer be hoped. At the same time a Lombard
embassy reached him, professing that Desiderius
had already restored every thing to the Pope. Charles
sent three messengers of his own to Rome to ascertain
the facts. They reached Rome just after its deliverance
from the fear of a siege by the retreat of Desiderius
from Viterbo. The Pope related to them in order all
the late events: and sent with them other messengers
of his own, conjuring Charles afresh to carry into effect
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page447">[pg 447]</span><a name="Pg447" id="Pg447" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the promises which he had formerly made with his
father to St. Peter, and to fulfil the redemption of the
holy Church of God<a id="noteref_239" name="noteref_239" href="#note_239"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">239</span></span></a> by compelling the perfidious king
of the Lombards to restore without contest to St.
Peter, both the cities and the other rights which he had
taken away. On their way to France the joint-messengers
appeared at the court of Pavia, and, by instruction
of Charles, urged Desiderius peacefully to restore the
cities and rights. He gave an absolute refusal, which
they carried to Charles.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Charles sent fresh messengers to Desiderius, and
offered him 14,000 gold solidi, if he would make restitution.
All was of no avail. When the messengers
returned to Charles, he brought the whole matter before
his dukes and chiefs, probably at the May diet, and an
expedition into Italy was resolved upon for the autumn.
The Frank army was summoned to meet at Geneva.
One part of it Charles sent by the Mons Jovis, the
St. Bernard; the other he conducted himself by the
passes of Mont Cenis, the same route which Pipin had
held in 754 and 756. When Charles reached the pass
above Susa, he found it strongly fortified and valiantly
defended by Desiderius in person, and his son, Adelchis.
Here it is said the Franks were so long detained, being
unable to break through the Lombard defence, that they
were on the point of retiring, when a secret road was
discovered to Charles, and their flank was turned. The
result was a precipitate retreat of Desiderius to his fortified
capital, Pavia, and of his son, Adelchis, to Verona.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page448">[pg 448]</span><a name="Pg448" id="Pg448" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
From that moment the chief struggle was concentred
about these two cities. Other cities of Upper Italy,
such as Turin, Ivrea, Vercelli, Novara, Piacenza, Milan,
Parma, Tortona, and the maritime cities, with their
castles, fell speedily into the hands of the Franks.
Charles sat down before Pavia at the end of September
or beginning of October, 773. That royal city of the
Lombards, in the eighth century, was first among all
the cities of Upper Italy, not only for its riches and
magnificence, but for its military strength. Near the
confluence of the Ticino and the Po, it was esteemed
almost impregnable. It had resisted Odoacer, and
Alboin required more than three years to take it, which
he accomplished rather by famine than by force.
Charles encamped with his army round it, and completely
enclosed it with lines and trenches. He sent for
the queen Hildegarde and her children. He made an
attempt to take Verona, but found it too strong for anything
short of a regular siege, defended, as it was, by
the most valiant Adelchis. However, the widowed
queen Gilberga, with her children, who were therein,
surrendered themselves to him. They disappear henceforward
from history, and are supposed to have been
confined in Frank monasteries. Charles spent the feast
of Christmas in the camp at Pavia. All we know of
these months is the two words of Eginhard, that he spent
them, <span class="tei tei-q">“much employed”</span>.<a id="noteref_240" name="noteref_240" href="#note_240"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">240</span></span></a> We may conclude that not
only the siege of Pavia, but the settlement of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page449">[pg 449]</span><a name="Pg449" id="Pg449" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
numerous cities in North Italy, which yielded to him,
well occupied his time.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But Charles had hitherto never seen Rome, and the
feast of Easter, which fell in that year, 774, on the 3rd
April, drew him with a great attraction to visit the
tombs of the apostles, and he resolved to be present for
the Paschal rites. He left therefore his army under the
command of his chief officers and with a great train of
bishops, abbots, judges, dukes, and counts, and a large
escort of warriors, took the road of Tuscany, which probably
had been in a great part subdued, and advanced
so quickly that he reached the gates of Rome on the
morning of Holy Saturday.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Great was the joy of Pope Adrian to hear of this
unexpected visit of Charles, and his rapid approach.
He made the utmost preparation to receive so great a
king, who had likewise the special dignity of Rome's
Patricius, that is, her sworn defender. He sent out all
the judges of Rome to a spot thirty miles away near the
lake of Bracciano, where they awaited him with banners
displayed. At a mile from Rome, near Monte Mario, by
order of the Pope the soldiers under their respective
leaders, and the children who were learning letters, were
drawn up to meet him, and bearing in their hands
branches of palm and olive sang welcome to him. The
standards of crosses were carried, as in the reception of
an exarch or a Patricius. When the king of the Franks,
Patricius of the Romans, met these crosses, he descended
from horseback with his officers, and walked the rest of
the way on foot to St. Peter's. There, Pope Adrian,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page450">[pg 450]</span><a name="Pg450" id="Pg450" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rising early with all the clergy and people of Rome waited,
to receive the king of the Franks at the top of the steps
leading into the court of the Basilica.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At that time there were thirty-five steps in five series
of seven each. When Charles reached these steps, he threw himself on
his knees, and so ascended,<a id="noteref_241" name="noteref_241" href="#note_241"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">241</span></span></a> kissing
separately each one of the thirty-five in the fashion of
a pilgrim. At the top he found Pope Adrian; they
embraced each other, and the king holding the Pope's
right hand they entered the church together, all the
clergy and the monks singing, <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed is he who
cometh in the name of the Lord”</span>. When the king
with the bishops, abbots, judges, and all the Franks of
his train, came to the Confession, they prostrated themselves
to our almighty God, and rendered their vows to
the Prince of the Apostles, glorifying the divine power
in him, who had given them by his intercession such a
victory.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After their prayer the king turned to the Pope and
earnestly requested of him permission to enter Rome, in
order to venerate the other churches of the city, and
therein pay his vows. Whereupon the Pope and the
king, together with Roman and Frank judges, descending
to the body of St. Peter, bound themselves by oath
to mutual protection. This permission to enter Rome
was granted in after times by the Popes to Roman
emperors themselves, as often as they approached the
gates of Rome with armed force. After this permission
received Charles and the Pope rode in solemn pomp
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page451">[pg 451]</span><a name="Pg451" id="Pg451" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from St. Peter's to the Lateran, through the whole of
Rome. And Charles, in the Lateran church, witnessed
the Pope's celebration of the baptismal rite to the catechumens
as usual on that day.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So the Romans on that day first beheld the flower of
the greatest western nation passing in the pomp of
armed men by their palaces, porticoes, Capitol, forum,
and colosseum, with the greatest champion of Christendom
then in the glory of his manhood at the age of
thirty-two years. His secretary, Eginhard, attests his
stature to have been seven of his own feet, and his whole
aspect was full of majesty. When he ascended on his
knees the thirty-five steps leading to St. Peter's, separately
kissing each, he manifested in his own person the
truth of the reply which nearly fifty years before Pope
St. Gregory II. had made to the eastern emperor, Leo
III. Leo threatened that he would tear down the
statue of St. Peter. St. Gregory said that all the
nations of the West regarded him as a God upon earth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After this Charles returned to the meadows of Nero
by St. Peter's wherein foreign armies usually encamped.
At the following dawn of Easter day the Pope sent his
chief officers and soldiers to conduct Charles in great
pomp to Santa Maria Maggiore, where, with all his Franks,
he heard the Pope sing Mass. After Mass the Pope
received him to a banquet at the patriarchal palace of
the Lateran. On the two following feasts the Pope,
according to usage, celebrated Mass on the Monday at
St. Peter's, on the Tuesday at St. Paul's, in presence
of the king. At the Mass in St. Peter's Anastasius
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page452">[pg 452]</span><a name="Pg452" id="Pg452" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mentions that the Pope caused the ceremony called
Lauds to be inserted before the Epistle. It was sung
before Popes and emperors at their accession. It consisted
of the clergy dividing themselves in two bands
before the altar, when the archdeacon on one side
intoned with loud voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“O Christ, hear us!”</span> the other
side responded, <span class="tei tei-q">“Long life to our Lord decreed by God,
Roman Pontiff and universal Pope!”</span> This was repeated
three times; a short litany followed, in which to each
invocation made by the archdeacon, the other side
replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“Give him help”</span>: and it ended with a triple
Kyrie Eleison. With this rite on that Easter Monday
of 774 Charles was solemnly acclaimed as Patricius of
the Romans. Eginhard in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Life”</span> says that Charlemagne
would never put on a foreign dress, however
splendid: and that he broke this rule twice only, both
times at Rome, the first at the request of Pope Adrian:
the second at the request of his successor, Pope Leo III.,
when he wore the long tunic and cloak, and was shod
also in Roman fashion. Now twenty years before, that
is, in 754, Pope Stephen II. had crowned Pipin and his
two sons Charles and Carloman kings of the Franks, and
created them also Patricii of the Romans. Charles
would seem to have considered this ceremony a solemn
inauguration of this dignity. It was from this time,
774, that in his public acts he styled himself king of
the Franks and of the Lombards, and Patricius of the
Romans.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In that same week before Charles left Rome he transacted
affairs of the utmost importance with the Pope.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page453">[pg 453]</span><a name="Pg453" id="Pg453" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ecclesiastical hierarchy in France, the rights of
metropolitans, and the other churches had fallen in the
last eighty years under great usurpations, which all the
zeal of Pipin had not been able to remedy. Adrian
prevailed on Charles to work a restoration of the ancient
state. He also drew from the archives of the Roman
See two authentic codes, one containing the old order of
the ecclesiastical provinces and dioceses in France; the
other, the councils and canons of the Greek and Latin
church. These were of the greatest service to Charles
in the synods and capitulars and wise regulations which
he made for the restoration of the Church in France.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But further, the Pope addressed himself to obtain
from Charles the renewal and confirmation of the promise
made in April, 754, by king Pipin and Charles
himself to Pope Stephen II. The king promised not
only to reconquer for the Holy See the exarchate and
Pentapolis, then occupied by Aistulf, but to add to them
likewise all the provinces of nearly all Italy from the Po.
That promise was grounded upon the design then entertained
by the Pope and the king to put an end altogether
to the Lombard rule. But at the siege of Pavia,
in 754, the Pope and Pipin were so far moved by the
supplications and promises of Aistulf, that they left him
the Lombard kingdom. Giving up that first design,
they made with him the treaty of Pavia, that compact
between the Franks, the Lombards, and the Romans,
which during eighteen years was appealed to as the
basis of their political relations. But in this interval
the incorrigible perfidy and ambition of Desiderius, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page454">[pg 454]</span><a name="Pg454" id="Pg454" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his obstinate refusal of all terms of agreement, had
last led Adrian and Charles to resume the original
intention of Stephen and Pipin. Charles after forcing
the pass above Susa resolved to pluck up by the roots
the Lombard power. Thus the conditions of 754, having
returned in 774, would bring back the first promise of
Pipin, and the compact of Pavia in 756 having been
trodden under foot by Desiderius, and torn at the
sword's point, the compact of Quiersy was restored to
force. It had not been annulled but suspended.
Adrian therefore took the excellent opportunity of
Charles's presence in Rome to complete the work so well
begun by Stephen II. The fresh inauguration of Charles
as Patricius helped to obtain from him a solemn confirmation
of the former compact. His piety and devotion
to St. Peter were not less marked than his father's, and
he assented to the Pope's desire.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On Easter Wednesday, the 6th April, 774, the solemn
act was completed which Anastasius has left carefully registered
in the Liber Pontificalis.<a id="noteref_242" name="noteref_242" href="#note_242"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">242</span></span></a> The Pope with all
the judges of the clergy and army, that is, all the
ecclesiastical and lay dignitaries of Rome, went to St.
Peter's, where he was met by Charles with all his train.
Here Adrian in a public speech recorded the acts of
kindness and attachment which for so long had joined
together France and the Holy See. He reminded
Charles of the promise which, in April, 754, his father
Pipin of sacred memory and he himself with his brother
Carloman and all the Frank judges had made and sworn
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page455">[pg 455]</span><a name="Pg455" id="Pg455" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
solemnly to St. Peter and Pope Stephen II. in the assembly
of Quiersy. That was to assure to St. Peter and all his
successors in perpetuity the possession of various cities
and territories of Italy. He then earnestly exhorted
and prayed the king to give entire accomplishment to
that promise. Charles asked that the whole tenor of
the promise of Quiersy should be read before him.
Having heard it read, and greatly approved of it, with
his judges, he most willingly accorded the request of the
Pope, he immediately ordered his chaplain and notary
Etherius to draw out another deed of promise and donation
exactly similar to the first. In this he granted to
St. Peter the same cities and lands and promised to give
them over to Pope Adrian, marking out the limits.
These are, says Anastasius, as we now read them in the
text of donation, from Luni and the isle of Corsica, by
Parma, Reggio, Mantua, and Monselice, embracing the
whole exarchate of Ravenna as it was of old, the province
of Venetia and Istria, the duchies of Spoleto and
Benevento. This Charles subscribed with his own
hand, and caused it to be subscribed by all his bishops,
abbots, dukes, and counts. After this the king and his
nobles, having placed the deed, first upon the altar of
St. Peter, and then within the Confession, took a terrible
oath to St. Peter and Pope Adrian, to maintain every
syllable of its contents, and they placed the deed in the
hands of the Pope. Further, Charles made Etherius
write another copy of the same donation, placed it with
his own hand on the inner altar of the Confession, under
the gospels which were wont to be kissed there by the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page456">[pg 456]</span><a name="Pg456" id="Pg456" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
faithful, that it might remain in most secure guarantee
and eternal memorial of the devotion of Charles and the
Franks to the Prince of the Apostles. Other copies
were afterwards made in authentic form by the proper
officer of the Roman Church, which Charles carried with
him into France.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus the original compact of Quiersy resumed its
legal force, and became the foundation of political right
in Italy. It is true that various reasons prevented the
compact from ever receiving its entire effect, but it became,
nevertheless, the standard which the Popes and the
kings of the Franks kept before them, the archetype on
which the public deeds and covenants renewed afterwards
so often in the middle ages between the emperors and
the Holy See were all framed. Adrian in thus claiming
and securing the sovereign rights already acquired by the
Roman Church may be called the second founder, after
Stephen II., of the temporal monarchy of the Popes.
Charles in crowning the work of Pipin showed himself
not only worthy of the Roman Patriciate, but of that
further dignity to which he was afterwards exalted by
Leo III. In the twenty following years the union and
cordial friendship which bound Adrian and Charles together,
maintained and increased prosperity in the Church,
and made closer still the old alliance of France with the
Papacy. Adrian ordered a prayer for king Charles to be
entered in the Roman liturgy, which thenceforward was
made for the Roman emperors, who succeeded him in his
office of Protector of the Church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Pope, in taking leave of Charles, predicted to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page457">[pg 457]</span><a name="Pg457" id="Pg457" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
him, in the names of St. Peter and St. Paul, a quick and
complete triumph over their common enemies, and the
total conquest of the Lombard kingdom: <span class="tei tei-q">“after which,”</span>
he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“you will render to St. Peter the gift which you
have promised him, and will receive in reward greater
and more signal victories”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And Adrian ordered that in all the monasteries, and
the twenty-eight titular churches, and the seven deaconries
of Rome, every day perpetual prayers should be
offered for victory to the Franks.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus Charles left Rome, and returned to his camp
before Pavia. By the first days of June, Verona had
fallen, notwithstanding all the valour of the prince
Adelchis, and Pavia had yielded. With the submission
of the capital, the few remaining cities, and Lombard
lords, accepted Charles for their king. Thus, in the
course of ten months, from September, 773, to June,
774, Charles effected, with great good fortune and little
effusion of blood, the most brilliant of his conquests.
He placed a strong Frank garrison in Pavia, he sent his
counts to govern the various cities and provinces: in
which, however, the chief Lombard dukes were comprised.
Charles did not change the constitution of the
kingdom: he did not make it a province of France. He
left its integrity and autonomy. He became himself
king of the Lombards, as before he had been king of
the Franks.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One of his first deeds<a id="noteref_243" name="noteref_243" href="#note_243"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">243</span></span></a> was to restore to the Holy See
all the cities and territories which, in his last years, Desiderius
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page458">[pg 458]</span><a name="Pg458" id="Pg458" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had invaded in the exarchate, the Pentapolis, or
the duchy of Rome. He thus gave back to Pope Adrian
full and pacific possession of the whole State of St.
Peter, such as it was after the donation of Pipin. This
was the chief, if not the sole, occasion of the war. It
would be the first fruit of the victory. That he performed
what he had promised is attested by his secretary,
Eginhard: <span class="tei tei-q">“Charles did not rest from the war
which he had begun until he had restored to the Romans
all which had been taken away from them. <span class="tei tei-q">‘The end
of this war was the subjection of Italy: and the restitution
to Adrian, ruler of the Roman Church, of the things which had been
seized by the Lombard kings.’</span> ”</span><a id="noteref_244" name="noteref_244" href="#note_244"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">244</span></span></a>
Other contemporary annals of the year 774 say: <span class="tei tei-q">“This
year Pavia was surrendered to the Franks: and Desiderius
was carried into France, and the lord king
Charles sent his counts through all Italy: he joyfully
restored to St. Peter the cities owed to him, and having
arranged everything, came speedily into France”</span>. His
return filled France with triumph.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Lombards<a id="noteref_245" name="noteref_245" href="#note_245"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">245</span></span></a> had been governed by their kings
with good laws and exact justice, but they afterwards
received better treatment under Charlemagne, a monarch
who, in loftiness of mind, in power and rectitude of
judgment, surpassed all Frank and Lombard kings.”</span>
But this encomium on the good laws and exact justice
of the Lombards belongs only to their treatment of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page459">[pg 459]</span><a name="Pg459" id="Pg459" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
themselves, for the Romans<a id="noteref_246" name="noteref_246" href="#note_246"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">246</span></span></a> looked with horror upon
the ignominious servitude with which Aistulf and Desiderius
threatened them. These kings sought to crown
that semi-barbarous occupation of North Italy during
two centuries by throning themselves in Rome, and
making the Pope their vassal. Aistulf sank before
Pipin, and Desiderius before Charles. The oppressors
of the Pope were swept away: his champion and protector,
Charles, went on henceforth from victory to
victory.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That the transition<a id="noteref_247" name="noteref_247" href="#note_247"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">247</span></span></a>
of the lands secured to the Pope
into the relation of vassals to a sovereign was a matter
of time is explained by the insufficient material force at
the command of the Pope, the love of independence in
the population, their power to resist, and the general
conditions of the time. Thus, from a letter of Adrian
to Charles, in 787 or 788, we learn that he announced
to the king how he had received the cities of Toscanella.
Bagnorea, and Viterbo, and requested from him the tradition
of Populania, and Rosella, near Piombino. Later,
he shows him that he had not yet received them, though
two messengers of Charles had been charged with their
delivery. Thus it required fresh efforts on the part of
the Franks, and fresh reminders on the part of the
Pope, to obtain the complete execution of the gift.
This does not show that Charles was unwilling to keep
his word: but it does show the difficulty of the matter.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page460">[pg 460]</span><a name="Pg460" id="Pg460" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
It was a great undertaking to pacify the population in
a number of cities, and to subject the great and the
small proprietors in them to the papal lordship. Adrian
had reason sometimes to express the wish to the king
that it might be accomplished in their life-time. Sometimes
Charles's own Commissioners were not trustworthy,
were disinclined to the Pope, were liable to be corrupted
or deceived, or made mistakes in executing their commission.
In March, 781, Charles came again to Italy,
celebrated Easter on the 15th of April at Rome, treated
with the Pope, had his little son, Pipin, four years old,
baptised, and made him, after the Pope had anointed
him, king of the Lombards. The duchies of Spoleto and
Benevento were to be vassal lands of the Pope. The
distance of the latter from the Franks, the connection
of the Duke Arichis with Desiderius, and the nearness
to the Greeks, who occupied Gaicta, and other parts
of Campania, caused special difficulties here. This
gradual acquisition of the territories promised by
Charles in 774 occupied a number of years; but in
them Adrian had every reason to praise the good faith
of Charles and the Franks.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the time that all dependence on Constantinople
was broken off, the sovereign authority of the Pope
appears entire.<a id="noteref_248" name="noteref_248" href="#note_248"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">248</span></span></a>
In all dealings with Pipin and the
Franks, in the compact of alliance at Quiersy, in the two
peaces of Pavia, in 754 and 756, between the Franks, the
Romans, and the Lombards, the Pope appears as the sole
actor and supreme arbiter of Rome's fortunes. He alone
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page461">[pg 461]</span><a name="Pg461" id="Pg461" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
confers on Pipin and his sons the dignity of Patriciate of
the Romans, thereby binding him to an armed defence of
Rome and its State. To the Pope alone Fulrad consigns
at St. Peter's the keys and the hostages of the cities of
the exarchate. The Pope covenants with Desiderius the
conditions for his elevation to the Lombard throne; demands
of him the surrender of the cities not yet restored:
guards against the schemes of the Lombards and the
Greeks to take away the sovereignty of the Holy See;
treats with the king of the Franks to frustrate them. He
continually sends his ambassadors into France, usually
prelates, sometimes dukes and Roman magnates. The
kings of France send to him their messengers; treat with
him of all public affairs of Italy. The people of Spoleto,
Reate, and elsewhere, when at the fall of Desiderius they
voluntarily became subjects of the Roman State, swear
fealty to St. Peter and the Pope. In a word, in all
political acts, in all concerning the government and defence
of the State, the Pope alone speaks and acts in his
own name with supreme and independent authority.
No representative of the Senate or Roman people is seen
at his side, clothed with proper and distinct authority.
On the contrary, in the very gravest questions of State,
no decree of the Senate, no plebiscite, no form of citizen
suffrage is so much as hinted at. This is inexplicable
had Rome been governed as a republic, or if its citizens
had had any part of sovereign authority.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With this the language of the Pope himself exactly
agrees. He speaks as a king of the cities and provinces
of the Roman State. <span class="tei tei-q">“The territories of our cities, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page462">[pg 462]</span><a name="Pg462" id="Pg462" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<span class="tei tei-q">“our castle of Valens;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“this our city of Rome,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“our

<span class="tei tei-q">“our territories of the exarchate;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“this our province;”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“they are attempting to withdraw from our
dominion our cities of Campania, from the power and
dominion of St. Peter and ours;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“we have resolved
to send thither our main army;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“in all the parts
which lie under the dominion of the holy Roman
Church;”</span> these and such like expressions occur everywhere
in the letters of the Popes to the Frank kings.
These also are no less frequent and significative. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
holy Church of God and its peculiar people;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the Roman
Church and all the people subject to it;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“our people;”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“the people entrusted to us;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“all our people of the
Romans of that province;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“our people of the commonwealth
of the Romans”</span>. These expressions the Popes
used without doubt or reserve in public letters to the Frank kings and nation.
Adrian, in a letter to Charlemagne,<a id="noteref_249" name="noteref_249" href="#note_249"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">249</span></span></a>
declares his will to maintain and exercise in the
exarchate and Pentapolis exactly the same power which
Stephen II. had received. <span class="tei tei-q">“Our predecessor distributed
all appointments in the exarchate, and all who ruled received
their orders from this city of Rome. He sent
judges to right all who suffered wrong, to reside in that
city of Ravenna.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The interests of the Romans and the Franks, of the
Papacy and the Frankish kingdom, of Adrian and Charles,
became in this period blent together.<a id="noteref_250" name="noteref_250" href="#note_250"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">250</span></span></a> An indivisible
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page463">[pg 463]</span><a name="Pg463" id="Pg463" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
unity and sincere alliance existed between them. They
were the result of that great visit of Charles to Rome in
774. When that visit took place, Charles was almost
at the beginning of that wonderful career which has
placed him at the head of modern history. By the death
of his brother Carloman two years before, the whole
Frank inheritance came into his hands. In the three
years since 768, when Charles and Carloman had been
crowned on the same day as kings of the Franks, but in
different cities, there had been dissension between them,
and had Carloman lived, it was to be feared that the
young strength of the greatest western monarchy would
have been turned against itself, instead of being gathered
up together against the Saracen enemy who was bent on
the conquest of the world. But now the single hand of
Charles wrought it to a unity of power, moderation and
wisdom, which first became conspicuous on this visit to
Rome. By this act of spontaneous devotion he may be
said to have inaugurated the unequalled success which
afterwards attended on him. From that time, forty-two
years of reign were appointed to him, in which he became
greater and greater. The root may have been that first
visit which he made to Rome, shortly after that Pontificate
of Adrian began, in answer to his appeal. They
became from this time fast personal friends. It is to be
observed with what magnificent loyalty Charles took up,
repeated, and ratified in his own person, the act of his
father, Pipin, made twenty years before. That act of
Pipin is almost unique in history. When Stephen II.
came to him at Pontigny in 754, Pipin promised him <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page464">[pg 464]</span><a name="Pg464" id="Pg464" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
the love of St. Peter</span></em> to defend the city and duchy of
Rome from the intruding Lombard king, Aistulf, and so
not to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">give</span></em>, but to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">preserve</span></em> its sovereignty to St. Peter,
as throned in his successors, alike from Lombard robbery
and Byzantine neglect and impotence. He promised
also to recover the exarchate of Ravenna, and the province
on the Adriatic called the Pentapolis, already taken
by Aistulf from the Byzantine, and in his occupation,
and to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">give</span></em> them an inheritance to St. Peter. Also, he
received the title of Patricius of the Romans, then bestowed
upon him by Stephen II., with the engagement
and the right of protection carried by it. His sons
Charles and Carloman, then children, were associated
with him in these promises, and in the dignity of Patricius.
The nobles of the Franks assembled in diet gave
their sanction to these things: Pipin accomplished them.
He would not take to himself a palm of ground in that
rich territory which he partly preserved for St. Peter
alone, and partly bestowed upon him. Rome and its
duchy he preserved; the exarchate and Pentapolis he
bestowed. Stephen II. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reigned</span></em>, when he returned to
Rome, in 756, and his brother, Paul I., after him. The
Lombard kingdom, from the taking of Pavia in 756, continued
by Pipin's permission. The last Lombard king,
Desiderius, repaid all this by perpetual encroachment
upon the cities given to St. Peter. The Lombard faithlessness
is repeatedly dwelt upon in the contemporary writings
of the Popes Stephen II., Paul I., Stephen III., and
especially Adrian I. Charles had listened to the solemn
appeal of Adrian to right him. He came to Rome, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page465">[pg 465]</span><a name="Pg465" id="Pg465" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the greatest warrior of the West ascended as a pilgrim
on his knees the thirty-five steps which led to the tomb
of the Prince of the Apostles. He was welcomed at St.
Peter's Confession as Patricius, in the way that Popes
and emperors alone, upon their accession, were welcomed.
And before he left Rome, at the request of the Pope, he
ordered his father's deed to be read before him; in the
midst of his princes, and with their consent, he re-affirmed
it: and he guarded the throne of Adrian as Patricius
during that pontificate, which, until seventeen hundred
years from St. Peter had elapsed, had no equal in length.
In all this Charles equalled and repeated the generosity
of his father.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How greatly the Popes esteemed the deeds of Pipin
and of Charlemagne is witnessed perpetually by the
letters of the day contained in the Codex Carolinus.<a id="noteref_251" name="noteref_251" href="#note_251"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">251</span></span></a> In
them the Frank king is constantly likened to Moses and
to David, who delivered the people of Israel from
Egyptian bondage and heathen oppression. He is called
perpetually, <span class="tei tei-q">“our helper and defender after God,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the
guardian of holy Church,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the liberator of the Christian
people,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the ransomer of the Roman Church, and all the
people subject to it”</span>. To him is attributed the prosperity
and security of Rome and the whole province of Roman
Italy, which is said to be redeemed by him. No tongue
can express or praise sufficiently his benefits. God alone
can reward him. All nations must acknowledge his defence
of the Church of God, and magnify him for it over
all the kings of the earth.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The effect of the Pipinian donation, confirmed in so
splendid a manner by Charles, had two results at once of
inestimable value: one to free the Popes and the inhabitants
of Italy from the perpetual invasion, threats, and
devastation of the Lombards. Thrice since the assault
of the emperor Leo III., in 726, upon the faith and internal
government of the Church, had Rome been in the
utmost peril of subjugation, once by Liutprand, then by
Aistulf, lastly by Desiderius. What would have been
the condition of the Pope under such a king as Aistulf
or Desiderius, seated at the Capitol? He could only
expect a servitude far worse than had ever been suffered
under the vice-cæsars of Ravenna, or the cæsars of Constantinople.
The original Roman empire had been
broken into a multitude of independent kingdoms.
That changed condition of the Christian society of itself
required that there should be lodged in its head a
greater independence of the civil power. The hand of
Charles, coming down upon the hand of Pipin, assured to
Adrian the legal recognition of a sovereignty sufficiently
large to secure him in the guardianship of the faith
which was the chief work of St. Peter's See in every age.
And so the misery which the rudest barbarian horde
began in 568 was stayed at last in 774: and if Gregory
the Great, in his time, complained that he had
been for thirty years keeping watch and ward against
Lombard violence and intrigue, the four great pontiffs,
Gregory II., Gregory III., Zacharias, and Stephen II.,
witnessed the last access of their attempt at domination,
and the royal city of Ravenna acknowledged in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page467">[pg 467]</span><a name="Pg467" id="Pg467" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Pope Adrian, not only its spiritual head, but its
temporal sovereign.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the same time the second inestimable benefit of
deliverance from the eastern despotism, fastened upon
Italy since the time of Narses, took place. Some slight
sketch of what the exarchate had been to Italy has been
attempted. At last those two hundred years of misery
were closed: the universal consent of the peoples of central
Italy accepted with delight the Papal sovereignty.
From the time of Justinian to Stephen II.—perhaps it
should rather be said from the time of Leo the Great,
the Popes alone had cared for Italy. They alone had
possessed the power, the wisdom, and the charity to
meet, in some degree at least, the calamities which rained
down upon that land, reduced to the condition of a
<span class="tei tei-q">“servile province”</span>. Forty years after St. Gregory the
Great, in the middle of the seventh century, a Pope had
been torn from his sick bed, laid before the altar in the
Lateran Basilica, carried to Byzantium, judged by the
senate as a traitor for the exercise of his spiritual rights,
and left to die of famine in the Crimea.<a id="noteref_252" name="noteref_252" href="#note_252"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">252</span></span></a> In the middle
of the eighth century if we plant ourselves, and look
through the events of two or three centuries, a certain
fact comes out clearly. No one can assign the precise
point of its completion, but it is seen attested by a
multitude of indications. The Popes in gradually taking
an acknowledged sovereignty, only yielded to the long and
ardent desire of the peoples at whose head they stood, no
less than to the stringent demand of public necessity.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page468">[pg 468]</span><a name="Pg468" id="Pg468" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The feeling of the subject here answered
to the fact in the prince: that is, as the Popes
were princes by actual necessity so long before
they had the name and solemn right to it, so the
Romans, and the Italians of the exarchate and the
Pentapolis were spontaneous subjects of the Popes
long before they bore the legal title. A mutual attraction
joined the two together. The Popes through charity
for the public good began to exercise in behalf of an ill-treated
or a deserted population the part of provident
civil governors; the people from gratitude and affection
clung more and more to the Popes. The ever increasing
calamities and the common trials which pressed on the
Popes and the Italians in those miserable times, partly
caused by the Byzantine emperors, partly by the barbarous
Lombards, drew them more closely together,
until the Popes found themselves sovereigns, and the
people found themselves subjects, in a complete civil
society. But the character of that society was indeed
paternal: and as the civil bond sprung from a spiritual
fathership, Pipin and Charlemagne named with the
name of St. Peter himself the State which their love and
reverence for him had partly preserved and partly
created.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Among the events of history, as the historic mind
would ponder them, or the judgments of God, as the
Christian mind would interpret them, there are none
greater than the two which for some time past I have
been attempting to narrate or to contemplate. One is
the wandering of the nations on the north of the great
inland sea: the other is, the wandering of the nations on
its south. Having reached the last year of the eighth
century, we may cast a glance back upon both, and
unite, if it may be, in a single picture the action upon
both of a power which owed its institution only to the
greatest fact of all facts concerning our race, the assumption
of human nature, the soul and body of man, in
His own Person, by the Creator of all things, the Son of
God. That power existed only in virtue of certain
words uttered and a certain will exercised, during His
life upon earth. As the last of His thirty-three years
was beginning, He had said to a man: Thou art the
Rock, and upon this Rock I will build My Church, and
the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. How far
did the gates of hell advance upon the Church of God in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page470">[pg 470]</span><a name="Pg470" id="Pg470" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the four hundred years which elapsed from the death of
the great Theodosius?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When he closed his eyes in the year 395, the great
empire of Augustus in the East and West was still intact.
The fifth and the sixth centuries may be said to
be filled by the fall of that empire in the West. I have
required ten chapters to give even a slight account of the
effects produced upon the Christian Church by the wandering
of the northern nations to the time of St. Gregory
the Great. But the seventh and eighth centuries are
filled with the pouring out of the Mohammedan flood
upon the Christian people, which had more or less
remained after the wandering of the northern nations
ended in their settlement. It is another convulsion
equal in its range and perhaps still greater in its effects
than that which made Teuton tribes the masters of Gaul
and Spain and Britain, of Germany, of Italy, and Illyricum.
The peoples of the north had struggled for
hundreds of years to break the barriers of the Rhine
and the Danube, and in their savage ferocity and tameless
independence wrest the South, so long coveted, from
the civilised but degenerate Roman. The prize, which
they had almost reached in the third century, was saved
from their grasp until the fifth by a succession of brave and
able generals invested with imperial power. But the
Teuton could both admire and receive the law and the religion
of the empire which he overthrew. Far otherwise
was it, when a savage tribe of Arabia, kindled to white
heat by a fanatic and false belief, burst upon a despotic
empire in which Christian faith and morality were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page471">[pg 471]</span><a name="Pg471" id="Pg471" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
deeply impaired. It needed but the third decade of
one emperor's reign to abrogate the Roman sovereignty
held during seven hundred years over Syria and Egypt,
and to establish the sway of a false prophet, the bitterest
enemy of the Christian faith, over the very city which
contained the sepulchre of Christ. <span class="tei tei-q">“The law had gone
forth from Sion and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem,”</span>
and thither all Christian nations sent a host of
pilgrims to kindle anew their faith and love before the
shrine which had held for a day the source of all that
life, the Body of the God-man. Now that shrine, with
all the memorial places of the Divine Life upon earth, fell
into hands whose work it was to set up instead of the
Christ, a man of turbulent passions and unmeasured
ambition: instead of the Christian home, the denial of
all Christian morality: instead of a Virgin Mother
placed at the head of her sex, and unfolding from age to
age the worth and dignity of woman, the dishonoured
captives of a brigand warfare. All this took place within
ten years after the death of Mohammed, and by the
end of the reign of Heraclius, when the greatest triumph
ever won by a Roman emperor over the rival Persian
monarchy was followed by the most ignominious defeat
from a troop of Arabian robbers, and the permanent
abandonment of Roman territory. During the sixty
following years, not only had Antioch and Alexandria, as
well as Jerusalem, become Mohammedan, but the last
fortress of Christian power in the East, the impregnable
city of Constantine, trembled repeatedly at the approach
of Saracen hosts, being rescued rather by its matchless
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page472">[pg 472]</span><a name="Pg472" id="Pg472" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
position, its strong walls, and the invention of the Greek
fire, than by the superior valour of its defenders. At the
end of that seventh century, the whole northern coast of
Africa had passed away from Roman to Saracenic rule:
from the Christian faith to its Mohammedan antagonist.
In ten years more, the Saracen banner crossed over the
straits of Gibraltar, and the Church of Spain fell under
its domination. At this time the eastern empire,
diminished as it had been, passed through severe revolutions.
It seemed that from intestine dissension
and the despotism of one crowned adventurer after
another, the remnant of the eastern realm, which during
seventy years could hardly maintain itself against Saracen
aggression, was coming of itself to an end. In this
uttermost extremity at Constantinople, a soldier had
risen from the ranks to be a trusted general, and when
the empire received him for its chief, a long prepared
attack by the chalif on his capital was beaten back
successfully by Leo III. In the time of the chalif
Walid, who reigned from 705 to 715, the Arabian flag
floated over the walls of Samarcand: its conquest had
stretched to the foot of the Himalayas. His governor in
Africa, Musa, had carried the bounds of his empire to the
Atlantic ocean. The single city of Ceuta owned still the
Byzantine sway. And the Christian count, Julian, for a
private wrong, betrayed to the Saracen the city entrusted
to his charge. Musa added almost all Spain
to the Saracen domain. Constantinople had been
besieged in 668, and saved under Constantine the
Bearded; it was saved again in 718, under Leo III.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page473">[pg 473]</span><a name="Pg473" id="Pg473" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
These two deliverances, with the fact that it had not
been taken in all the interval from the time of Heraclius,
may be termed the only checks received from Christians
by the Mohammedan conquest in the whole period from
the death of Mohammed. Had it succeeded in gaining
Constantinople when it gained Toledo, it is difficult to
see how the universal enthralment of the Christian faith
under the almost insufferable tyranny of the Arabian
false prophet could have been prevented.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus when St. Gregory II. succeeded to the throne of
Peter in 715, and Leo III. to the throne of Constantine
in 717, the position of the Christian Faith before Islam
seemed to stand in terrible danger.<a id="noteref_253" name="noteref_253" href="#note_253"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">253</span></span></a> The sons of Mohammed,
lords of Asia, Egypt, Africa, and Spain, were
besetting, with long prepared fleet and army, the last
remains of the Greek power in Constantinople on the
East, and on the West had only to look to the conquest
of France. If they became masters of France, there
was no strength left to resist them, neither Italy
divided between Lombards, Greeks, and the old inhabitants,
subjects of one or the other, nor Germany
divided among various peoples. The whole world
seemed to be reserved for the anti-Christian kingdom
of Mohammed: all nations about to pass under the
hard servitude of a conquering Arabian tribe, instinct
with hatred to the Christian life; all women to become
slaves of man's passion: all reason to endure subjection
to a lie imposed by the scimitar. What we have since
seen of Mohammedan rule in Asia and in Africa during
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page474">[pg 474]</span><a name="Pg474" id="Pg474" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
twelve hundred years, seemed then on the point of becoming
the general doom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That was the time chosen by the eastern emperor,
after a reign of ten years, to attempt the imposition of
a fresh heresy upon Pope Gregory II. The man who
was formally bound by his position as Roman emperor,
and by the oath taken at his coronation to defend the
Church as it had come down to him from the seven
preceding centuries, was filled with a desire to remodel
the practice of that Church in all its worship. He advanced
claims which were not only an invasion of its
independence by the civil power, but in themselves
rested only upon the practice and the sentiments of the
Church's two great enemies, the Jew and the Saracen.
The Jew abhorred the relative worship paid to the
images and pictures of our Lord, of His Mother, and of
the saints, because he utterly denied the fact of the Incarnation,
which these images and pictures were ever
presenting in the daily worship of the faithful. The
Mohammedan shared this abhorrence, because he denounced
the Christian as an idolater for his belief in
our Lord, as Son of God. Leo III. took up the mind of
the Jew and the Saracen into his own rude and unformed
nature, and bent the whole force of the imperial
power to subdue the Pope to his will. Spain had just
fallen into Mohammedan hands: and the lord at Damascus
ruled from the Atlantic to Samarcand. Under
his rule, which was the bitterest ignominy to every
Christian, lay more than half the empire which Justinian
had left. Then, in 726, a contest, the most unequal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page475">[pg 475]</span><a name="Pg475" id="Pg475" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which can be conceived, began between Pope
Gregory II. and the emperor Leo III. It continued
fifty years under Leo and his son, Kopronymus, who
died in 776. In the course of it, Leo sent a great fleet
against the coast of Italy, whose commander was instructed
to take and plunder Ravenna, to proceed to
Rome, to put down all opposition to the imperial
heresy, and to carry Pope Gregory captive to Constantinople,
after the fashion used in the preceding century
to Pope St. Martin. Pope Gregory II. endured
to his death the joint heresy and tyranny of the eastern
lord, and induced the irritated populations of Italy
still to keep allegiance to him. His successor, Pope
Gregory III., used the same forbearance. Pope Zacharias
for ten years went on enduring, while the Frank nation
accepted, on his judgment, a new dynasty. For twenty-eight
years, from 726 to 754, no amount of wrong
could induce four successive Popes to throw off the
allegiance which had pressed upon Italy as a servile
province since the conquest of Justinian. At length,
the fourth Pope, Stephen II., was deserted in his utmost
need by the emperor himself: was threatened with a
Lombard poll tax laid upon Rome, and the position of
vassal to an Aistulf in the city of St. Peter. Then the
eastern servitude at last dropped, and the issue of the
most unequal combat, begun in 726, was terminated by
the compact ratified at Quiersy in 754, and carried out
at Pavia in 756. This compact secured to Pope
Stephen and his successors the position of sovereign
princes in Rome, and the territory attached to it. In
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page476">[pg 476]</span><a name="Pg476" id="Pg476" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
756 Pope Stephen II. re-entered Rome as its acknowledged
civil sovereign. Yet, in the eighteen years following
this event, the last king of the Lombards renewed the
ambition of Liutprand and Aistulf, to become the lord
of Rome, and the renewal of Pipin's gift by Charlemagne,
in 774, alone closed the momentous contest
which, beginning in 726 with an attack on the unarmed
Pope, ended in the deliverance of Italy from the
most cruel of thraldoms, and made the Pope, who had
long been Rome's only support and benefactor, its
temporal as well as its spiritual head.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the time of that event, more than four centuries
had passed since Constantine, in 330, consecrated his
city on the Bosphorus to be Nova Roma, pursuing his
idea to found a capital which should be Christian from
its birth, and the centre of a great Christian empire.
Five years before the Church had met for the first time
in General Council. The object of its meeting was to
refute and censure an attack upon the Godhead of its
Founder, and the place at which it met was a city immediately
on the Asiatic side of the strait, on which
what was then Byzantium stood. The position taken
by Constantine was to guard with the imperial sword
the chamber in which the Church's bishops sat, to
accept their decrees as the utterance of Christ himself,
and to add the force of imperial law to the spiritual
authority which he acknowledged them of themselves
to possess.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the baptism of Byzantium as Nova Roma in
330, fifty years succeed to 380, in which Constantinople
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page477">[pg 477]</span><a name="Pg477" id="Pg477" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
becomes the chief seat of the very heresy condemned by
the Church at the Council of 325. Its see is sought
after immediately as the prize of worldly ecclesiastics in
the East. Eusebius, the man who presently became its
bishop, deceives Constantine into fostering the heresy
which he abhorred: its bishop, Macedonius, was the
docile servant of the emperor Constantius in his attempt
to change the faith of the Church: its bishop, Eudoxius,
nurtured the emperor Valens in the same heresy. But
the succession of Popes in Julius, Liberius, and Damasus,
frustrated these efforts of the bishops of Nova Roma in
the first half century of its promotion: and when Theodosius
sat on the throne of Constantine, with his colleagues,
Gratian and Valentinian, their law of 380 called
upon their peoples <span class="tei tei-q">“to hold the religion which is proved
to have been delivered to the Romans by the divine
apostle, Peter, since it has been maintained there from
his time to our own”</span>.<a id="noteref_254" name="noteref_254" href="#note_254"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">254</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the terrible effects wrought upon the eastern
episcopate by the Arian assault had not been finally
overcome. The next attack upon the Person of our
Lord proceeded from the eloquent Syrian, Nestorius, who
had been put in the see of Constantinople. It required
all the energy of Pope Celestine and the patriarch Cyril
of Alexandria, to overcome that heresy which still attacked
the Incarnation, and was supported by court
favour at the eastern capital, and the jealousy of its
emperor for his bishop. It is remarkable that the First
Council at Ephesus, in 431, should have been followed by
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page478">[pg 478]</span><a name="Pg478" id="Pg478" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a Second Council at the same place in 447. This second
Council was, so far as its convocation and its constitution
went, regularly entitled to be a General Council. Its
decree was in favour of an opposite heresy to that of
Nestorius, on the same subject of our Lord's Person, and
its originator was the monk Eutyches, in high repute at
the head of a monastery at Constantinople. The Council
after its completion was rejected, and the heresy overthrown,
by the single arm of St. Leo the Great. The
whole Church at Chalcedon accepted his act and acknowledged
his Primacy. But this Monophysite heresy had
driven its roots deep into the Greek mind. During two
hundred years, to the time of Mohammed himself, its
effects may be traced, corrupting the unity of belief in
the eastern patriarchates, encouraging perpetual party
spirit, breaking constantly the succession of bishops in
the hierarchy. In the time of St. Leo, the patriarch
Proterius, who succeeded the deposed Dioscorus, was
murdered by the Monophysite faction. A few years
later the bishop of Constantinople used this heresy for
the purpose of exalting his see against Rome, which had
just been deprived of its emperor, and its government
left in the hand of barbarians, who were also heretics.
Thus supported by imperial power, Acacius brought
about a schism which lasted for thirty-five years. The
resistance of seven Popes, the last of whom, Hormisdas,
obtained the full result which his predecessors had sought
for, frustrated this second century of Byzantine aggression
upon the faith and government of the Church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Indeed, so striking and unquestionable was the submission
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page479">[pg 479]</span><a name="Pg479" id="Pg479" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the Byzantine sovereign, and the recognition
by the Byzantine bishop of the Papal authority, that
from this time forth a somewhat new course was pursued
by the eastern emperor and patriarch in regard to that
authority. The purpose of Justinian in his subsequent
reign was, while he acknowledged in very ample terms
the papal primacy, to subject it in its practical execution
to his own civil power. Thus when he had become by
conquest immediate lord of Rome, he summoned Pope
Vigilius to attend him at Constantinople. During eight
years he subjected him to perpetual mortifications. He
issued doctrinal decrees and required the Pope to accept
them. His laws fully admitted the Pope's rank; he
never denied his succession from St. Peter: but his pretension
was to make the five patriarchs use their great
authority in submission to himself; and he included the
first of the patriarchs in this overweening claim, as his
namesake Justinian II. signed his council in Trullo at
the head of all, and left a line between himself and the
patriarch of Constantinople for the signature of Pope
Sergius, which was never given.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The result of Justinian's oppression of Pope Vigilius
was to create temporary schisms in some parts of the
West, through dread of the bishops that something had
been conceded to the usurpation of the civil power. Not
until the time of Gregory the Great could the Apostolic
See recover the injury thus inflicted. But Justinian did
much more than persecute a particular Pope. I think
it may be said with truth, that from the conquest of
Italy under his generals, Belisarius and Narses, it was the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page480">[pg 480]</span><a name="Pg480" id="Pg480" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
continual effort of the Byzantine emperors to subject the
Papacy to the civil power in the exercise of its spiritual
supremacy. From Justinian to Constantine Kopronymus—a
period of more than two hundred years—that is
the relation between the Two Powers which the eastern
emperors carried in their minds and executed as far as
they were able.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fourth century of Nova Roma's exaltation opened
with the strongest assertion of this claim which had yet
been seen. The able and unscrupulous Sergius had
become patriarch of Constantinople, and was prime
minister of the emperor Heraclius. The whole East was
teeming with Monophysite opinions, and every city, in
proportion to its size and dignity, torn with party conflicts
arising out of dissension respecting the Person of
our Lord. Sergius thought he had devised a remedy
by that Monothelite statement which, as he imagined,
enabled him to present in a more conciliating form the
old heresy put down by St. Leo and the Council of
Chalcedon. He led the emperor Heraclius to publish
this heresy in the imperial name. Then four successive
patriarchs of Constantinople were found to put
all their spiritual rank at the service of two emperors,
Heraclius and Constans II., to formulate the heresy, and
force it, if possible, on the Popes. Ten successive Popes
resisted—one to martyrdom itself—and after a struggle
of fifty years, Popes Agatho and Leo II. at the Sixth
Council—when the eastern emperor for the moment became
orthodox, and his patriarch and bishops followed
him—condemned and expelled the heresy. But this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page481">[pg 481]</span><a name="Pg481" id="Pg481" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fatal attempt of Sergius and Heraclius had been exactly
coincident with the rise of Mohammed. The Greek
contention respecting the Person of Christ had lasted
three hundred years, from the Nicene Council, when the
success of the false prophet led vast countries, once the
most flourishing of Christian provinces, to yield to the
human authority of a robber, and to put him in the
place of the God-man whom by their works they had so
often denied. And so the fourth century from the exaltation
of Nova Roma had been completed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet still it was reserved for the fifth century to Constantinople,
at a time of its extreme humiliation, when
for ninety years it had only just obtained from a new
and undisclosed invention the power to keep the all-conquering
Saracen outside its walls—to make its final
and most absolute attack upon the elder sister whom it
acknowledged as the leader of the Christian faith.
Syria and Egypt and Africa and Spain were gone, and
the Persian monarchy, for so many hundred years the
rival of the Roman, equally was absorbed in the enormous
Saracen dominion, and the cities of Asia Minor
were in daily dread of the same foe prevailing over their
religion and desecrating their homes. Such was the
condition of things when the yet remaining Christian
emperor assumed over the Christian Church the power
of Mohammed's chalifs in the territory which they ruled
in Mohammed's name. Another fifty years occur in
which, when after the orthodox patriarch Germanus had
been forced to lay the insignia of his rank on the altar
of Sancta Sophia and depart, three Iconoclast patriarchs
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page482">[pg 482]</span><a name="Pg482" id="Pg482" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in succession, Anastasius from 730 to 753, Constantine
from 753 to 766, and Nicetas I. from 766 to 780, placed
themselves at the disposal of their emperors to corrupt
the faith and subject the government of the Church,
until at the Seventh Council once again an eastern
emperor became orthodox: and an eastern orthodox
patriarch followed again in Tarasius; and Adrian I. was
received as Pope, being no longer a vassal of Constantinople,
but a sovereign prince.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Upon these antecedents ensued the temporal sovereignty
of the Pope. What is the witness of history to
the spiritual action of the Popes during this long period
of 426 years, from 330, when Byzantium became Constantinople,
to 756, when the people of Rome welcomed
with universal jubilee the return of their Pope, Stephen
II., as sovereign?—when again in 774 Charles at the beginning
of his great career approached St. Peter as a
pilgrim, and renewed to him his father Pipin's act of
munificent piety.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us follow the course of the heresies which, during
four centuries and a half from the Nicene Council in
325, to the defeat of the Iconoclasts at the Seventh
Council, attacked the faith of the Church. They turn
upon the Person of our Lord: upon that mighty fact of
the Incarnation which filled all men's minds. The Arian
denied that He was God; the Nestorian and Monophysite
sought in opposite methods to deal with His two
natures. The Monothelite pursued the question to its
inmost point as it touched the two natures in the operation
of the Will; his error in its root was especially
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page483">[pg 483]</span><a name="Pg483" id="Pg483" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Eutychean. When the question began the original
eastern patriarchates of Alexandria and Antioch were in
their primal state and glory. They held their descent
from Peter, like the See of Rome. Like the Apostolic
See their chairs were at the head of a great mass of
bishops, Antioch in particular having a crowd of metropolitans
governing important provinces, who looked up
to the great see of the East, who, when the patriarchate
was vacant, voted for the election, as they received from
him the confirmation of their own election. Alexander
in the mother see of Egypt had been the first to condemn
his own insurgent priest, Arius, and at the Nicene
Council he was attended by his deacon, Athanasius, who
was soon to succeed to his place, and raise during his
episcopate of forty-six years the See of St. Mark to its
loftiest renown. Eustathius, at the same Council, the
twenty-fourth bishop of Antioch, was a noted confessor,
and with Alexander contributed to its decision; while
Pope Silvester threw the whole weight of the West,
which had no doubt as to the Godhead of Christ, in
favour of the same result. As yet Constantinople was
not; and the See of Jerusalem, though highly honoured,
was in the hierarchy a simple bishopric suffragan to
the metropolitan of Cesarea. There could be no controversy
more reaching to the inmost heart of faith in the
Church than that which concerned the Person of the
Lord. Taking the four centuries and a half as a whole
we find that the eastern patriarchates failed under the
trial. The first of them, Alexandria, had for its two
greatest teachers Athanasius and Cyril, both doctors of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page484">[pg 484]</span><a name="Pg484" id="Pg484" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Church, both renowned in their defence and illustration
of the doctrine that God became man. But no
sooner had Cyril died than his see became the centre of
the Monophysite error. Almost the whole Christian
people of Egypt followed its bad lead, and when the
Saracen chief took Egypt and Alexandria in the name
of Mohammed he found support rather than opposition
in the mass of the Christians, who, in their bitter party
hatred, called the remnant of Catholics still remaining
Melchites or Royalists as the most opprobrious epithet
they could devise. And in process of time, under Omar
and his successors, the country of Athanasius has become
the heart of Mohammedan learning and zeal.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Scarcely less melancholy is the history of Antioch
and its twelve provinces of metropolitans, with their 163
bishops.<a id="noteref_255" name="noteref_255" href="#note_255"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">255</span></span></a>
Eustathius was speedily deposed by the Arian
faction, even before Athanasius, and during ninety years
a perpetual schism preyed upon the dignity of the
great eastern see. In the fifth century it was unable to
prevent the advance of Constantinople. It fell a speedy
prey to the Mohammed's chalif, and from that time the
man who bore the name of its patriarch was often a
dependent and pensioner at the eastern capital. Jerusalem
had succeeded in obtaining the patriarchal dignity
at the Council of Chalcedon. But in less than two
hundred years Omar polluted its holy place by his
presence, and the most stirring voice uttered by its
patriarchs is that cry of its noble Sophronius, bidding
his chief bishop go to the throne of Peter, <span class="tei tei-q">“where the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page485">[pg 485]</span><a name="Pg485" id="Pg485" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
foundations of holy doctrine are laid,”</span> and invite the
sitter on that throne, who was Honorius, to rescue the
faith imperilled by his brother patriarchs, Sergius at
Constantinople, and Cyrus at Alexandria, leaders of the
Monothelite heresy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When therefore the emperor Constantine Kopronymus,
in 754, took by the hand Constantine whom he had
chosen to be ecumenical patriarch, and presented him as
the elect of the emperor to the Council of more than
three hundred bishops, whom he had convoked to sanction
his own heresy, while twelve years afterwards, as the
sequel of many torments, he executed him and had his
body dissected; we may say that the eastern patriarchs
had utterly failed to defend either the faith or the
hierarchy of the Church. Mohammed did not appear to
complete the work of Arius, until the descendants of
those who condemned Arius in 325 had obscured by
interminable disputes during three hundred years what
their spiritual ancestors had declared to be the faith of
the Church. The causes of this failure had been internal.
There had been great bishops in the East during this
period. Chrysostom had sat in Constantinople, suffered,
confessed, and been exiled before Nestorius, who sat there
also, and was exiled for his heresy. Germanus, in the same
see, did not yield to Leo III., and in that worst time
confessed, and his place was forthwith taken by Anastasius,
who subscribed all Leo's evil will. Kopronymus
strove to exterminate the monks, who suffered every
extremity for their maintenance of the faith. But as
the main result the Byzantine despotism had overcome
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page486">[pg 486]</span><a name="Pg486" id="Pg486" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the eastern episcopate. I do not know how more telling
proofs of that evil victory could be shown than that
Philippicus Bardanes, in 711, during his ephemeral reign,
should be able to assemble a council at Constantinople,
which he required to restore the Monothelite heresy, condemned
at the Sixth Council, and scarcely met with an
episcopal opponent; and again that Kopronymus could
assemble another large council in 754, to establish his
Iconoclast aggression, which was received without dissent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How then was the faith preserved during these four
hundred and sixty years?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From Pope Sylvester to Pope Stephen II. we count
sixty-one Popes. In that long period of time the doctrine
of the Godhead and the Person of Christ with all its manifold
consequences was fully drawn out. The variation
which had been seen in the patriarchal and episcopal
sees of the East was never found at Rome. All political
and external help may be said to have failed the Popes.
They lost their own western emperor, and the sole
remaining eastern emperor turned against them. More
also, he set up against them a new bishop who at the
beginning of the time did not exist, the bishop of the
eastern capital. The eastern lord added from generation
to generation rank and influence to this bishop. He made
him his own intermediate instrument of communication
with all the bishops of his eastern realm, to whom it
had been the continual policy of Justinian and his
successors to grant great political privileges, making
them in large degree partakers of civil authority.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page487">[pg 487]</span><a name="Pg487" id="Pg487" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
They sought to rule the East throughout its manifold
divided interests by the authority of the local bishops;
and they sought to rule the bishops themselves by their
own patriarch. Rome, from being the head of the Roman
monarchy at the beginning of the period, ceased to be
the capital even of a <span class="tei tei-q">“servile”</span> Italy, the captive of
Belisarius. The Popes passed through Odoacer, Theodorich,
Theodatus, also Vitiges and Totila, also Liutprand,
Aistulf, and Desiderius. Their elections, when made, were
delayed in their recognition, or even controlled in their
choice. They saw a crowd of northern raiders take
possession of the whole West, and at one time the very
heresy which at the beginning of the period had been
condemned by the Church, was in possession of all the
governments of the West but that of the Franks, and
had for the chief ruler of its councils and the head of
the regal league against the faith of Rome the greatest
man whom the northern tribes can show during their
time of immigration, and he had made Italy powerful
and respected, and cultivated Rome with extreme
solicitude. When St. Silvester sat in St. Peter's chair,
Rome was the single capital of the whole empire; when
St. Leo sat there he witnessed the fall of the West, but
stood imperturbable before Attila and Genseric; when
St. Gregory sat there, he divined from the temporal
ruin and desolation of Rome, which he saw perishing
piecemeal around him, that the world's last time was
coming. When St. Martin sat there, he was torn from
his sick bed by the eastern master to die in the
Crimea; when St. Gregory II. sat there, the same eastern
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page488">[pg 488]</span><a name="Pg488" id="Pg488" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
master threatened to break in pieces the statue of St.
Peter in his Basilica. But in all the four hundred and
sixty years from the first to the second Nicene Council,
the witness of Rome to the Divine Person of her Lord
was clear and distinct. Neither the greatest nor the
worst of her opponents had subdued that witness, or
rendered it faltering or indistinct. For this reason it
was that the Pope, whose life the Iconoclast soldier, when
clothed with the imperial purple, five times attempted,
could reply to his threat, that all the West looked upon St.
Peter as a God upon earth; that the one Teuton king
before whose victorious reign that of Theodorich is pale
and colourless, ascended on his knees the steps before
St. Peter's tomb, laid upon the altar over his body the
gift of temporal sovereignty, and went forth from that
moment the predestined civil head of that new Christendom
which St. Peter had made out of the northern
adventurers.

Taking in all this time the simple witness of history,
I ask if in it the words of our Lord to Peter were not
palpably fulfilled: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou art the Rock, and upon this
Rock I will build My Church”</span>. If the Rock had not
been, each one in this long line of heresies would have
destroyed the Church. The line of St. Athanasius was
not infallible; the line of St. Ignatius of Antioch was
annulled after frequent falls by the Mohammedan
captivity; the line of Byzantium had some saints, but
was prolific in heretics, and the last utterance of
Jerusalem before it fell, when the Saracen ascetic
voluptuary trod its courts, was uttered by its patriarch
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page489">[pg 489]</span><a name="Pg489" id="Pg489" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

The state of the eastern Church from the Council of
Chalcedon to the final assault of the emperor Leo III.
upon the whole fabric of Church government is one
continual descent. It has certain recoveries, as the
cessation of the Acacian schism, in 518; as the reversal
of the Monothelite tyranny, under Constantine Pogonatus,
in 680; as the repudiation of the still greater Iconoclast
tyranny a century later, at the Seventh Council in 787,
under Pope Adrian and the patriarch Tarasius. But
even General Councils were attacked by eastern emperors
in the last excesses of their overgrown domination. As
Philippicus Bardanes got together a great Council in 711
to denounce the Sixth Council, so the Emperor Leo
the Armenian had deposed an unbending patriarch,
Nicephorus, in 815, supplied his place with the yielding
Theodotus, and found another council in the same year
to anathematise the work of the Seventh Council.
Three more Iconoclast patriarchs—Theodotus from 815
to 821, Antonius I. from 821 to 832, John VII. from
831 to 841—close this evil list of heretical bishops. The
feast of orthodoxy was established in 842. The incessant
attempts of the Greek emperors to meddle with the faith
took presently another development. They could no
longer oppress as their subject a sovereign Pope. When
they could not oppress him, they learnt to deny him. In
less than another generation the schism of Photius began.

Such was the first century running from the time that
Leo the Isaurian made, in 733, his creature Anastasius
ecumenical in the sense that all the remaining Greek
empire was put under his patriarchal jurisdiction. But
it is plain that long before this, the Greek empire, so far as
its own episcopate was concerned, had ceased to possess
any inflexible rule of doctrine. The most venerable of
its authorities, the original patriarchs of Alexandria and
Antioch, had yielded before the Nestorian and Monothelite
storms; had perpetual interruptions in their succession,
sometimes had a double succession—one Catholic,
another Monophysite—had submitted to the State-patriarch
set over them at Constantinople; and being
found in this condition by the Mohammedan flood, had
seen their former dignity all but overwhelmed in its
swelling waves. The western Church, which from the
time of the northern wandering of the nations had been
visited by unnumbered catastrophes, had, on the contrary,
possessed in its bosom exactly that inflexible rule of
doctrine which the East wanted: a rule of doctrine
not imposed by civil despotism, but the very root
as well as the bond of its episcopate. The Ostrogoth
had made his kingdom in Italy, and the Visigoth his
kingdom in Spain; the Frank, the Burgundian, and many
more set up realms in France and Germany, whose limits
were in perpetual fluctuation; seven or eight little Saxon
kingdoms were dividing in Britain the old Roman unity.
These Teuton tribes had two qualities in common—great
personal valour and the most persisting spirit of
division. Endless were the intestine quarrels and separations
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page491">[pg 491]</span><a name="Pg491" id="Pg491" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
between those of the same northern race, who in
political condition had hardly passed the tribal state.
Every invading army whose commander became a king
in the conquered territory had its own local interests,
but none of that great political sense which had nurtured
the empire of the Cæsars. The one Ostrogoth who had
such a sense had grown up a hostage at Constantinople,
and though it is said that he could not read, had certainly
divined and carried off with him into the Italy which
he captured the imperial secret of government: that is,
the force of unity, justice, and subordination of the part
to the whole; and Theodorich had come to the conclusion
that he could not make Italian mind and Gothic manners
coalesce in the structure of a kingdom. His device to
rule them equally and separately scarcely lasted for his
life. After ruling with equity, he died in remorse. No
stronger instance of this great defeat can be found than
the custom of the Merovingian race to the end. Their
monarchy was in their eyes a family property. When
their father died they took the throne as a part of the
paternal inheritance. It was not delivered down in
whole as a mighty trust of the nation itself. If there
were several children, their swords cut the patrimony
into slices, and each carried off his bit, like a wild beast.
No political sense presided here. The sole solicitude of
each was that his lot might not be of less value than his
brother's.<a id="noteref_256" name="noteref_256" href="#note_256"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">256</span></span></a>

There exists no history giving in detail the most
wonderful event of these troubled centuries—that is, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page492">[pg 492]</span><a name="Pg492" id="Pg492" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
process by which the Arian heresy, which, in the time
of Theodorich, had possession of all these peoples—except
the Franks, and the Saxons, who were pagans—finally
became Catholic: a conquest of the northern warriors
which one of the greatest enemies of the Christian faith
seems to consider a more wonderful deed than the conquest
of the former Roman world, so far as it was
achieved at the time of Constantine's conversion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At Rome the Pope sat through all these centuries, the
visible representative of all that was good in the Roman
empire, of law, justice, order, besides holding in himself
the inflexible rule of faith. The Chair of Peter had no
rival in the West, the eldest of its bishops looked up with
reverence to his single and immemorial pre-eminence.
Their local influence had in each of them its weight with
their own people. For instance, St. Gregory of Tours
was of an old senatorian Gallic family: all the interests
of the population around him, whether Frank or Gallic,
known to him as a native of the soil. In this double
position much nearer and dearer to him was the Petrine
descent, by consecration of which he maintained as bishop
the Christian faith. Thus in the see of Tours he protected
the temporal rights of his people, and resisted in
particular the violent acts of king Chilperic. The faith
itself was to him the strong exemplar of political sense:
the one family of Christ bore in its very bosom the
society of nations. He could not say the creed without
feeling that the centre of faith was the natural centre of
all humanising influence. The Saxon bishop in Northumberland
would recognise the Saxon bishop in Kent in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page493">[pg 493]</span><a name="Pg493" id="Pg493" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
spite of intervening Mercia. The episcopate set up
among the German tribes by St. Boniface in the name
of the Popes, was the form of such unity as afterwards
led these separate tribes to coalesce in an empire. And
they coalesced with such difficulty as to show that
without the spiritual bond they would have remained in
their original antagonism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the last century of Merovingian rule the inapt
government and private vices—if a king's vices can ever
be called private—had inflicted a very great injury both
on the civil and the ecclesiastical administration of the
great Frank empire. The intercourse in writing between
the Popes of the sixth century with the Frank rulers
had been greatly interrupted in the seventh. While
perpetual domestic murders and sensual crimes polluted
the royal family, the nobility had become disordered;
national councils were suspended, and in too many sees
the bishops no longer answered in character to those who,
in the time of Gregory the Great, had built up Gaul. At
that moment there sprung from two great nobles of
Austrasian Gaul, Arnulf, afterwards bishop of Metz, and
Pipin of Landen, a family whose saintly virtues as well
as their nobility raised it to great power. In 673 Pipin
d'Herstal, who by his father descended in the second
degree from Arnulf, and by his mother from Pipin of
Landen, was mayor of the palace, and the degenerate
blood of Chilperic and Fredegonde was put to shame by
the chief minister of the kingdom. The race of Clovis
was dying out in sensual cruelty: the family of Arnulf
was raised up to take its place. In forty years, Pipin
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page494">[pg 494]</span><a name="Pg494" id="Pg494" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
d'Herstal, as mayor of the palace, used the royal power
with such effect as greatly to restore the unity of the
kingdom. After his death and an interval of trouble
his son Charles, in 707, united in his hands all the power
of the Franks. It was just a hundred years from the
death of Mohammed, when, in 732, the Saracen army
having under his chalifs conquered all the East and the
South, and over-run Spain, had only one more battle to
fight with the bravest nation of the West, in order to
trample the cross under their feet. The flood had passed
the Pyrenees, and advanced over prostrate Aquitaine to
Poitiers, which it had taken. As it issued from that city,
the bastard son of Pipin d'Herstal, still mayor of the
palace in name, but sovereign of the Franks in fact, met
it with the rapidly collected warriors whom he had so
often led to victory. Then, it is said, the Saracen and
the Christian hosts for seven days watched each other;
the Arabs on their light horses and in their white mantles,
the Franks with their heavy iron-clad masses. On the
eighth day, a Saturday at the end of October, the Arabs
left their camp at the call of the Muezin to prayer, and
drew out their order of battle. Their strength was in
their horsemen, and twenty times they charged the
Frankish squares, and were unable to break them. An
Arab writer says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Abd Errahman, trusting to his
fortune, made a fierce attack. The Christians returned
it with as much firmness. Then the fight became general
and continued with great loss on both sides. Assault
followed upon assault until four o'clock in the afternoon.
The Frankish line stood like a wall of iron.”</span> Then a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page495">[pg 495]</span><a name="Pg495" id="Pg495" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cry for succour was heard from the Arab camp. Duke
Eudo with his Aquitains and Basques had surprised
those left to guard it. Disorder and panic arose among
the Saracens. Charles saw and ordered the whole line
to advance. The wall of iron moved and all fell before it.
Abd Errahman passed from rank to rank to check the
flight, and did wonders. But when, struck by many
lances, he fell from his horse, disorder and flight prevailed.
They burst into the camp and expelled Eudo. Night
came on, and Charles kept his army in its ranks on the
plain, expecting a fresh battle on the morrow. On that
morrow the Franks saw the white tents, but the Arabs
had fled under cover of the night. The booty was
great. The Franks report that there was no pursuit;
the Arabs, that the Christians pursued their victory for
many days, and compelled the fugitives to many battles,
in which the loss was great, until the Moslem host threw
itself into Narbonne.<a id="noteref_257" name="noteref_257" href="#note_257"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">257</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In that battle Charles merited his title of <span class="tei tei-q">“the
Hammer”</span>. Had he or his Franks blenched upon that
day, Europe would have become Mohammedan, as three
hundred years before in the battle of the nations by
Macon it would have been the prey of the Mongol, had
Attila prevailed. Carcassonne and Nimes and all southern
France had yielded. But the hammer of Charles descended
on the Saracen anvil. His son, king Pipin,
carried on his work in southern France, and his grandson
Charles, before his death, had become lord of an
united realm from the Ebro to the Eyder. Islam never
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page496">[pg 496]</span><a name="Pg496" id="Pg496" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
advanced further in the West. As France in the fifteenth
century owed its deliverance to the maiden of Arc, so in
the eighth, not Gaul only, but all the West would seem
to have owed its inheritance of the Christian name to
the four great men whom Providence raised up in the
family of Arnulf of Metz, and Pipin of Landen. Pipin,
the mayor of the palace, Charles the Hammer, Pipin the
king, and Charlemagne, are four continuous generations
from grandfather to greatgrandson the like of which
I know not that any other family can produce.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An old man so feeble that he had hardly strength to
cross the Alps, and was almost killed by the exertion,
laid his hand on the head of Pipin, and the mayor of the
palace became king of the Franks. The hand was the
hand of St. Peter. Forty-six years later the same hand
will be laid upon the head of his son; and the king of
the Franks will become emperor of the Romans; and
the Saracens who felt the arm of one Charles in the
battle by Tours, will feel another Charles rise up before
them to meet the Moslem lord of the southern and
eastern world on equal terms.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After Charles left Rome,<a id="noteref_258" name="noteref_258" href="#note_258"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">258</span></span></a> at Easter, 774, as above
narrated, attempts were made against him by the Lombard
dukes, and Adelchis, the son of Desiderius. In
spite of the Saxon wars he was in upper Italy at the end
of the winter of 776: he prevailed over his opponents,
sent his counts to the various cities, and protected the
State of the Church. At the end of 780 he was again
at Pavia, and he celebrated the feast of Easter on April
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page497">[pg 497]</span><a name="Pg497" id="Pg497" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
15, 781, at Rome. Here Pope Adrian crowned his son
Pipin king of Lombardy, and the youngest, Louis, king
of Aquitania. All seemed to go well. Greek messengers
from the regent Irene, widow of Leo IV., brought
proposals of agreement and treaty. During this longer
sojourn the new arrangement of the Lombard kingdom
would be completed. Frankish counts took the place of
the old dukes, whose relation to the central power had
been far looser than that of their successors was made.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The introduction of the royal missi and their action
upon the administration of law likened subject Italy
much more to the other states of Charles. The position
of the native population was not essentially altered, but
the improvement of the laws helped them. Charles all
the while was carrying on war after war with the resisting
Saxons, enlarging the Christian domain by founding
bishoprics as far as the Weser and the Elbe, taking the
Spanish marches from the Arab, and the eastern marches
from the Avars, uniting the dukedom of Bavaria with
his kingdom, and carrying out that mighty work of
civilisation which has made his name immortal for its
religious institutions, its legislation, and the encouragement
which he gave to literature.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Early in the year 787 Charles was again with Pope
Adrian at Rome. In a rapid campaign he reduced to
his obedience Arichis, duke of Benevento, who was
married to a daughter of Desiderius; and returning
once more spent Easter with Adrian. It was the last
meeting between those two fast friends. On Christmas
day, 795, Adrian closed a pontificate of nearly twenty-four
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page498">[pg 498]</span><a name="Pg498" id="Pg498" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
years. Three years before Rome had been desolated by
one of its most fearful inundations, and the Pope had
gone about in a boat succouring the needy. This pontificate
was both in its spiritual and temporal consequences
most brilliant.<a id="noteref_259" name="noteref_259" href="#note_259"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">259</span></span></a> Adrian possessed every quality
which should adorn a great Pope, a tender and active
piety, a zeal the ardour of which was tempered by
wisdom: a union of goodness and resolution, so that in
the exercise of his charge he combined the affection of a
father with the authority of a teacher, and the vigilance
of a Pope. Charles mourned for him both as a friend
and father. He had an inscription of thirty-eight verses
engraved in golden letters on the black marble stone
which covered his tomb. He had Masses said for his
soul in all churches; and dispensed great alms in distant
lands, especially to England. In his letter to Offa, king
of Mercia, he wrote:—<span class="tei tei-q">“We have sent you these alms
begging intercession for the Apostolic Lord Adrian, not
that we doubt, that that blessed soul is at peace, but to
show our faith and affection for a most dear friend”</span>. It
cannot be doubted that Adrian's influence upon the
great king, since he first came to Rome in 774, had prepared
him for the future exaltation which he was to receive
in that same church of St. Peter, the steps of
which he had ascended on his knees twenty-six years
before. The day after Adrian's death, Leo III. was
chosen his successor. He was by birth a Roman, and
brought up in the patriarchal palace, and is described
by contemporaries as learned, eloquent, and beneficent.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page499">[pg 499]</span><a name="Pg499" id="Pg499" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the gift of king Pipin to Pope Stephen II.,
when the keys of the cities surrendered to him were
laid upon the altar over the body of St. Peter, to the
repetition of that gift by Charles in 774, and again from
that most solemn action of Charles to the year 800, no
difference in the relation of the Pope to the king of the
Franks took place. In the first instance, in the year
754, Charles had been made Patricius of the Roman
Church together with his father, and had as such taken
on himself its protection and defence. Therefore the
Popes took pains, in particular Leo III., that the
Romans acknowledged under oath this relation, binding
themselves to observe the rules which their Patricius
should make for the security of the Church. No conclusion
can be drawn from this, as to an overlordship
of the king of the Franks in the territories assigned to
the Pope. Pope Adrian and Leo III. sent to Charles a
standard together with the keys of St. Peter's tomb.<a id="noteref_260" name="noteref_260" href="#note_260"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">260</span></span></a>
The jurisdiction which the king of the Franks exercised
in Rome as Patricius was not an overlordship; it was
necessary for his office as Protector. But now an extraordinary
event took place. In the year 799, three years
after the accession of Leo III., a tumult broke out which
in its savage violence surpassed that under Stephen III.
On April 25, St. Mark's day, the Pope was conducting
the solemn procession ordered by St. Gregory the Great,
from the Lateran to St. Lorenzo in Lucina. A band of
conspirators broke out of the Flaminian way, not far
from the Church of St. Silvester. At their head were two
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page500">[pg 500]</span><a name="Pg500" id="Pg500" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nephews of the late Pope Adrian: Paschalis, the Primicerius,
that is, the first of the seven Palatine judges, and
Campulus, the treasurer, another of them, both in immediate
attendance on the Pope. Leo III. was thrown
to the ground, and an attempt made to tear out his eyes
and his tongue. He was dragged into the Church of St.
Silvester, and thence taken to the monastery of St.
Erasmus on the Cælian.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The conspirators had not succeeded, as they hoped, in
blinding the Pope. His wounds were wonderfully
healed. His friends rescued him on a dark night from
his confinement in the monastery, and brought him
safely to St Peter's. A large number of the people and
clergy surrounded him. The Frank duke came from
Spoleto with a hurriedly collected troop, took him from
St. Peter's, and carried him to Spoleto, where again
bishops, priests, and laity surrounded him with congratulations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When Charles heard of these events in Rome he caused
the Pope to come into his kingdom. He was in the act
of marching against the Saxons. At Paderborn he learnt of
the Pope's approach. He sent to him<a id="noteref_261" name="noteref_261" href="#note_261"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">261</span></span></a> archbishop
Hildebald, his chaplain; the Count Anochar and
his son Pipin, with many counts, and a considerable force
to escort him, while he set in order the whole army for his
reception. When the head of the Church appeared all
fell on their knees to receive his blessing. Charles dismounted,
tenderly embraced the oppressed fugitive
before his army, and accompanied him to the cathedral.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page501">[pg 501]</span><a name="Pg501" id="Pg501" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Leo remained several days in the camp at Paderborn
to consult with the king about the state of things at
Rome, and what measures should be taken to meet them.
No doubt it was felt that the powers of the Patricius at
Rome must be increased, to give security in the future
to the Pope.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The conspirators had acted with great violence at
Rome, and sent to the king a list of accusations against
the Pope.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Pope returned to Rome accompanied by the archbishops
of Cologne and Salzburg, and a large escort of
Frank bishops and nobles. All the clergy, senate,
people, soldiers, the schools of foreigners, Franks,
Friesons, Saxons, and Lombards, also the chief matrons
of Rome came out to Ponte Molle to meet him, with
standards and crosses, attended him to St. Peter's, where
he sang High Mass, and the next day he re-entered the
city, and took again possession of the Lateran.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the summer of the following year, 800, Charles left
his capital, Aix-la-Chapelle. At Mainz he announced
his intention to go to Rome, that he might punish those
guilty of the ill-treatment of the Pope. It was his fifth
campaign in Italy. He stayed seven days in Ravenna,
which was now in the Pope's possession. At Mentana,
twelve miles from Rome, the Pope went out to receive
him. The next day, the 24th November, he came to
St. Peter's, where the people waited for him in the usual
order.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The king-protector declared that the chief object of
his coming was to clear the Pope from the accusations

brought against him, and for this purpose there was
held on 1st December a great assembly at St. Peter's
of archbishops and bishops, Frank and Roman nobility,
before the king and the Pope. <span class="tei tei-q">“Then all the archbishops, bishops,
and abbots said with one voice:<a id="noteref_262" name="noteref_262" href="#note_262"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">262</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">‘We

the supreme pontiff.’</span> Then the Pope said: <span class="tei tei-q">‘I follow the
example of my predecessors, and am ready to clear myself
of such false accusations’</span>. And on another day, before
the same presence, ascending the ambo, and holding
the gospels in his hands, he said, under oath, with a loud
voice: <span class="tei tei-q">‘I have no knowledge of these false crimes
which Romans, my unjust persecutors, have imputed
to me, and I never committed them. Whereupon they
gave thanks to God in a litany, and to our Lady the

Prince of the Apostles, and to all the saints of God.’</span> ”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After these things, on the birthday of our Lord
Jesus Christ, all were again assembled in the same

Charles, at the request of the
Pope, wore his Roman dress as Patricius of the Roman
Church and Commonwealth. That majestic figure,
seven of his own feet in stature, was vested in an inner
robe of pure white, hearing over it the purple mantle
which betokened his Frank monarchy. Pope Leo III.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page503">[pg 503]</span><a name="Pg503" id="Pg503" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
celebrated High Mass in person; Charles knelt on the
steps before the altar, his head bowed in prayer. Then
the Pope took the crown which lay on the altar, and
placed it on the head of the king of the Franks, and
cried with a loud voice: <span class="tei tei-q">“Life and victory to Charles
Augustus, crowned of God, great and peace-bearing
Emperor of the Romans!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The title was thrice proclaimed before the Confession of
St. Peter. And all the faithful of Rome seeing the
great guardianship and affection which Charles bore to
the Roman Church, and its ruler, assented with one
accord. And the same day the Pope anointed with the
holy oil Charles and the king his son.

Three hundred and twenty-four years had passed
since at the bidding of Odoacer the Herule and Ariun,
the Roman senate had sent a message to the eastern
emperor Zeno, declaring that no western emperor was
needed. During the whole of that intervening period
Rome had survived in virtue of St. Peter's primacy
seated in her. She had subdued the Acacian schism.
She had lived through the Gothic war and the five
captures by friends and foes. During two centuries of
Lombard invasion and of Byzantine oppression she
had remained unbroken. Upon the judgment of Pope
Zacharias, the most powerful nation of the West dethroned
the unworthy race of Clovis, and placed a nobler
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page504">[pg 504]</span><a name="Pg504" id="Pg504" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and more religious house on the throne of the Franks.
Another Pope, Stephen II., by his own authority had
made the newly anointed monarch Patricius of the
Romans, and he first, and then his son, during forty
years, had in that character protected the sovereignty
which he had partly recovered, so far as regarded Rome
and its own territory, and partly bestowed, so far as
regarded the exarchate as a gift to St. Peter. The
external protection had proved to be inadequate to guard
the papal succession in one case, the person of the Pope
in another, from domestic treason. And now the word
of the Pope alone summoned up from the past not only
the title but the power of the emperor, and invested
with it the greatest man of all those northern races, who
since the time of Theodosius had subjugated the Roman
western empire. Leo III. alone set the crown on the head
of Charles; not the crown which belonged to him as king
of the northern immigrants who had conquered Gaul,
but the crown of Augustus, given by Christ. <span class="tei tei-q">“To
Charles Augustus, crowned of God,”</span> the word ran. This
was the crown which Charles received, and which all the
nations subject to his sway acknowledged, as the gift of
St. Peter, seated in his see of Rome. The first and chief
duty of the sovereign so created was to guard the
Church of God. The four hundred years of Teuton
immigration passed by that act into the definitive recognition
of a new Christian people. Thereupon there
became a family of nations, whose common life and law
were the one Church of God, whose common territory
was named from its master, Christendom. The eastern
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page505">[pg 505]</span><a name="Pg505" id="Pg505" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
emperor in his ardour to impose heresy, had shown his
impotence to protect what Justinian had once acquired,
and Rome which created anew a western emperor was
definitively free from any civil subjection to the eastern.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Three chief aspects of this great act are to be considered:
how it regarded the West; how it regarded
the East; how it regarded the enormous Mohammedan
power which stretched from farthest West to farthest
East, from the Tagus to the Indus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First it is to be noted that the Pope alone made the
empire. As Stephen II. had conferred upon the newly
made king of the Franks the office of Roman Patricius,
and with it the jurisdiction in his own State requisite for
the fulfilment of that office, so, where the jurisdiction of
the Patricius had been proved to be insufficient, both by
the intrusion of the anti-pope Constantine into the Papal
See itself, and by the ferocious attack upon Leo III., a
reigning pontiff, during a solemn procession in the streets
of Rome, Leo III. created an emperor, who should have
a jurisdiction in Rome over all persons. He did not
make himself a vassal, but in making the emperor he
gave judicial rights in the State of the Church for the
carrying out the most important part of the emperor's
charge, to be Protector of the Roman Church. That Protector
was to be guardian of the whole Catholic Church:
and so he bore the name and title, of all other civil titles
the most respected, emperor of the Romans; Rome alone,
re-entering into the right lost in 476, and exercised now
by the voice of her sovereign, gave the title, not drawn
from the Franks or Germans, nor dependent on the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page506">[pg 506]</span><a name="Pg506" id="Pg506" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Byzantine, rather in itself a speaking sign that the
Byzantine subjection had passed away. The Roman, and
the Frank, and all the subjects of his vast domain
accepted Charles as <span class="tei tei-q">“crowned of God”</span>. That is, the
Successor of St. Peter named him emperor of the Romans.
As he had exalted a mayor of the palace to be king of
the Franks, and Patricius of the Romans, so he had
exalted the Patricius to be emperor; and because he was
himself in spiritual things the head of the whole Church,
he had made a particular king to be the advocate and
defender of the whole Church. No one else could do
what Leo III. did.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The annalists<a id="noteref_264" name="noteref_264" href="#note_264"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">264</span></span></a> of that age universally agree that it was
Leo III. who devised and executed the exaltation of
Charles to be emperor. The Pope in a deed granting
certain privileges to a monastery, dated on the very day
of his coronation, marks that his grant was made <span class="tei tei-q">“in presence
of our glorious and most excellent son Charles, whom
by God's authority we have this day consecrated to be
emperor for the defence and advancement of the universal
Church”</span>. Charles himself everywhere said that he was
<span class="tei tei-q">“crowned by the divine will,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“crowned by God”</span>.
Most wise was the intention of Leo, that the supreme
pontiff, the pastor and ruler of all the faithful, should
institute this sacred empire by crowning and proclaiming
Charles. It was thus that the Church and the supreme
pontiff determined the peculiar and essential character,
nature, and dignity of this empire. The purpose was
that among the kings there should be one, already most
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page507">[pg 507]</span><a name="Pg507" id="Pg507" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
powerful by the extent of his dominions, to whom
besides a special charge and dignity should be given.
This consisted in being the protector and defender of
the Church and the Roman pontiff, and of the whole
Christian society, to promote and spread abroad the
Christian faith with all its blessings. The Church on
her side, gave to this prince a pre-eminence over all other
princes. That intimate union, which ought to subsist
between the Two Powers, Spiritual and Temporal, preserving
to each its own dignity and honour, found its
practical and supreme expression in that mutual respect
of Pontiff and emperor to each other. Five centuries of
the Europe that was to be born came out of that act of
Leo III. on Christmas Day, 800. Legitimate order and
fixed possession were added to the innate courage and
the love for self-government of the Teuton tribes, which
thus grew into nations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Divide into its chief parts the union thus consecrated
before the eyes of all men, by an authority which all
men admitted.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First of all we find the nature of civil government in
general acknowledged by it. During five hundred
years from the time of Constantine this had been
upheld with unwavering steadfastness by the Popes.
Never had they acknowledged a rule of despotism. One
of the most marked characters of the Arian heresy was
its disposition to exaggerate the civil sovereignty,
admitting in it an absolute rule rather than a divine
delegation, and, extending that absolute rule into the
spiritual order of things. So far already had Arius
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page508">[pg 508]</span><a name="Pg508" id="Pg508" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
anticipated Mohammed. Against this confusion of the
Two Powers, and their absorption into one, Athanasius,
Hilary, and Basil, Popes Julius, Liberius, and Damasus
had struggled. A hundred years later Pope Gelasius
under Arian thraldom had maintained to the emperor
Anastasius the essential independence of the spiritual
power, and the defence in spiritual things due to it from
emperors. When another emperor, Leo the Isaurian,
had intruded, if possible, further into the fabric of the
Church than Anastasius, he was met, as has been seen
above, by St. Gregory II. Now, seventy years later, in
the last days of the eighth century, the Iconoclast storm
having broken in vain on the head of four successive
Popes, Leo III. set his seal upon all these acts of his
predecessors. He restored the empire, and in restoring
set it forth once again in its character of the supreme
earthly right consecrated to the defence of the divine
right and Christian faith. The marvel was that he
made the head of the Teutonic tribes the guardian of
Christ's religion, and invested him with the privileges
involved in that guardianship which a succession of
degenerate Constantines on the eastern throne had
abused. The chalifs had shaken to its centre the
Christian structure in the East; had stripped the
Christian empire of its fairest provinces; had set up
against it a religion of internecine hatred to its faith, of
perpetual pollution to its morals; and the Pope, when
the loss of Italy was added to all its other losses, had
established, in the person of Charles, Christian monarchy
in the West. It was no longer an attempt to veneer
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page509">[pg 509]</span><a name="Pg509" id="Pg509" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with Christian name an empire, all whose bureaucratic
despotism was founded in the heathen subjection of all
power to the State, but the establishment in a great
conqueror of an empire whose basis was essentially
Christian. Charles was <span class="tei tei-q">“Augustus crowned of God,
great and peace-bearing emperor of the Romans,”</span> not an
Augustus made by the senate and people of Rome, who
had become in Diocletian the representative of armies,
and in Byzantium continued a succession of dissolute
adventurers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again, Charlemagne received from the Pope a complete
code of Christian legislation, and as emperor he
made it his own, and made it the centre of civil right.
The act which constituted him emperor made Rome itself
the point of a vast circumference of nations. It
became for Christian contemplation what it had been for
heathen: Christian voices united with the heathen.
The imperial statute book spoke it out:<a id="noteref_265" name="noteref_265" href="#note_265"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">265</span></span></a> Rome
is our common country. Already Charles, as Patricius, had
received from Adrian I. a book of the councils and
canons accepted by the Holy See. With it beside him
he had restored order and law in the Frankish Church,
which the last century of Merovingian misrule had so
greatly impaired. He now added the imperial dignity
and power to that peculiar combination of moderation
and perseverance which marked his character. The
harmonious equilibrium of qualities,<a id="noteref_266" name="noteref_266" href="#note_266"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">266</span></span></a> excelling equally
in the arts of war and the arts of peace, and united with
fidelity to the Church of God, made him the greatest of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page510">[pg 510]</span><a name="Pg510" id="Pg510" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Christian sovereigns. Whatever he undertook he pursued
with unfailing ardour. What he began, he finished;
carrying on a multitude of things at once, he gave to
each his full attention. In a reign of forty-seven years
he made fifty-three military expeditions, most of which
he led himself; eight years he fought the Avars; and
thirty-three the Saxons. He enacted more laws than all
his predecessors united, as well the Merovingians as the
princes of his own family. Age, which brings fatigue
and relaxation to other workers, saw his energies increase,
for the fourteen years from 800 to his death showed his
greatest legislative activity. The man in armour never
laid aside his breastplate; his eye retained its penetration
and his hand its vigour till he went down standing
to his tomb, and there the great Christian emperor was
found seated on his throne, with sackcloth under his
imperial mantle, hundreds of years after his death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To put the laws and customs of the Church in the
hands of such a man as Augustus, crowned of God in St.
Peter's Basilica, was of itself to change the wandering of
the nations into an abode of settled peoples, capable of
growing into the brotherhood of a Christian bond. So
Leo III. completed the work of St. Gregory the Great.
In Gregory's time the Visigothic kingdom of Spain
had been already established on these same principles;
now that it had been overthrown by the Moslem occupation,
they were established on a vaster scale by the
central empire of Charlemagne. So the Church carried
her legislative wisdom, gained in the exercise of 800
years, into the civil counsels of princes.

Pipin le Bref,<a id="noteref_267" name="noteref_267" href="#note_267"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">267</span></span></a> great grandfather of Charles, had restored
in France the great assembly of the Field of May.
These assemblies were carefully held by Charles. Like
his predecessors he took no measure and promulgated
no law in opposition to the public wish. At Byzantium
the practice which had triumphed was <span class="tei tei-q">“the will of the
prince has the force of law,”</span> but the emperor Louis II.,
in 862, expressed the practice of Charles: <span class="tei tei-q">“Law is
made by the consent of the people, and the sanction of
the king”</span>. Every year at the Champs de Mai that
principle became a reality. The king of the Franks
appeared there the soul and centre of the assembly. He
convoked it when and where he pleased. He proposed the
subjects for its consideration, he gave his sanction to what
it passed. He dissolved it at his pleasure. But it was
consulted on all important acts of his government. It
gave its advice with unlimited freedom; it had full right
to amend the projects proposed. Often special commissions
composed of the most competent persons considered
what was brought before them; the bishops,
ecclesiastical affairs; the lords, political. The government
considered the interests of the Church with the
most constant care. More than one Champ de Mai held
by Charles bears the aspect at once of a council and a
parliament. The king presided, listened, advised. The
law which sprang from that familiar intercourse between
king and nation perfectly expressed the harmony which
reigned between an authority which was loved, and an
obedience which was free. There was no written constitution,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page512">[pg 512]</span><a name="Pg512" id="Pg512" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but it was one power exercised by sovereign
and people. The Capitularies remain the monument of
this immense activity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The royal commissioners, Missi Dominici, an institution
perfected by Charles, carried everywhere throughout
his vast empire a knowledge of the laws thus passed,
and reported to the sovereign how they were kept. By
them the king touched each member of his political
body. It was a class of removable functionaries, entirely
under the order of the central power. It was composed
chiefly, but not always, of bishops and counts. They
went four times a year, usually two and two, an ecclesiastic
and a layman, to inspect the district entrusted to
them. All authorities were subject to this inspection.
They reported to the sovereign upon all, and conveyed
to him the popular feeling, as well as informed him as to
the popular needs. This institution, together with the
Champs de Mai, contributed to the empire's unity by
maintaining its peace. It checked excesses of power in
the great proprietors.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An account is extant how these commissioners acted
in one of the remotest provinces, that of Istria. They
consisted of two counts and a simple priest. At their
arrival they held a public enquiry upon the conduct of
the religious and civil authorities. The patriarch of
Grado was obliged to appear in person, together with all
the bishops and counts of the province. After that they
considered the conduct of the duke John. The patriarch
and the duke were alike compelled to give pledges to
amend what had been wrongly done. All felt that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page513">[pg 513]</span><a name="Pg513" id="Pg513" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Charlemagne himself was behind his commissioners;
and when they departed it was with the full assurance
that their visit had not been in vain. It will be right
to take this instance as representing the government of
Charles everywhere, and at all times. For the first time
since the origin of Frank society a power existed, each
of whose acts indicated a resolution to maintain the
general good and to impregnate the whole nation with
the spirit of the sovereign.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In all this government the model of the Christian
hierarchy was before the mind of Charles, and in the
strength of union with it he worked. What is so
singularly civilising in his power is the extinction in his
personal character as ruler of anything local, bounded,
and particular, together with the maintenance of every
right in every place. The Pope was the head of the
Church, and he looked upon himself as the head of the
State; the Pope was surrounded in every province by
bishops, his colleagues and coadjutors; they worked
together in one mass. So Charles willed that his dukes
and counts should work with him in one mass for one
end, the pacific unity of his great empire. The act of the
Pope<a id="noteref_268" name="noteref_268" href="#note_268"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">268</span></span></a> in making him Roman emperor helped him greatly
to conceive of himself as the secular head of a Christian
brotherhood of peoples, as the Pope was its spiritual
head. But the act which made him emperor did not give
him secular dominion over any people not already subject
to him. For instance, it did not subject to him the
Saxon kingdoms in Britain. He was not territorial, but
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page514">[pg 514]</span><a name="Pg514" id="Pg514" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
moral leader and president in the council of kings; their
chief in the defence of the Church. He did not take
from the Greek empress or her successors any temporal
lordship; though the Greek pride long refused to acknowledge
him as an equal. The Pope remained what he had
been from the time of Stephen II., an independent
sovereign in the Papal State: he had not given himself
a master in erecting a new empire. In fact we see Leo
III. retain the exercise of his secular sovereignty, and
the emperor appear only as defender of St. Peter's landed
inheritance. Leo III. maintained the right of his
own officers against the interference of some imperial
commissioners, and distinguished accurately the limits of
the State of the Church, from the imperial realm. He took
measures against Arab inroads, to secure his State in full
independence. What he needed was the emperor's support
against the violent party spirit of the time; against such
deeds as the intrusion of a Pope upon the Apostolic See
by armed force; against the assault upon a Pope by
conspirators. This the authority of the emperor in Rome
secured. For that he had a jurisdiction, as the Patricius
had before. For this the Romans took an oath to the
emperor as well as to the Pope; to the one as protector
and advocate, to the other as temporal lord.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If in all this action Charlemagne had before him the
model of the Christian hierarchy, not only his own vast
kingdom, but all the nations of the West had spread out
before them in the forty-six years of his reign, but
especially in the last fourteen, when he had become, by
the Pope's act, emperor of the Romans, the cordiality
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page515">[pg 515]</span><a name="Pg515" id="Pg515" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of union between the two great powers of human life,
the spiritual and the temporal. The positive and
intrinsic effect of the Holy See as the inflexible rule of
doctrine and of justice on the Teuton features of the
several northern tribes was seen when a man of immense
natural capacity wielded so great a power in close conjunction
and amity with it. What can be further than
the action of Charles in the Champs de Mai, in the Missi
Dominici, in a legislation which considered all the needs
and desires of the subject, while it was supreme and
final in its authority, from the condition of the northern
tribes when they broke into the empire. The Vandals
howled around the walls of Hippo when St. Augustine
was repeating the penitential psalms on his death-bed;
while Charles kept under his pillow St. Augustine's City
of God, and strove to rule his empire for the maintenance
of the Christian faith. He was accomplishing that
union of many nations in one political bond as members
of the same religion which Augustine himself, the most
clear-sighted of saintly historians, was unable to contemplate.
The mixture of earth with iron in the feet of
the great heathen statue had wrought its dissolution;
but the Teuton monarch, who mounted on his knees the
steps of St. Peter's, kissing each separately, at the
beginning of his career pledged his faith to the Pope over
the tomb of the chief apostle, and before it ended he had
given a final check to the intestine struggles of disunion.
He had more than equalled the work of Constantine.
The great Roman was indeed personally,
though imperfectly, Christian. How much there was of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page516">[pg 516]</span><a name="Pg516" id="Pg516" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
policy, how much of faith in his conversion is a problem
too hard to solve; but he was baptised on his death-bed,
and the delay was probably of disastrous import to his
inward life; and his empire was, in a great degree, still
unconverted and heathen. His latter years were
especially faulty in his practical execution of the relation
between the Two Powers. From his time forward his
own special foundation at Byzantium declined more and
more, until the emperor who represented him became, in
Leo, the Isaurian, and his son Kopronymus, the greatest
enemy of the Church. But Charlemagne by his real
union with St. Peter's successor, imparted Roman order,
Christian civilisation, and civil constitution to that mass
of seething peoples. If in the five hundred years
succeeding Constantine his work deteriorated more and
more, until the city which he wished to be the head of
Christian empire yielded half of it to the Saracen,
and then became the very seat of schism, the West, in
the five hundred years which followed Charlemagne, saw
a family of Christian and Catholic nations surround the
throne of the chief apostle, nations which his Primacy
had called into existence when he placed the imperial
diadem on the head of <span class="tei tei-q">“Charles Augustus, crowned of
God”</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If from the West we extend our view to Charlemagne's
effect on the East, we find the new order of things which
his empire introduced, present him as the temporal head
of the Christian faith in union with its spiritual head
over against the powerless Byzantine emperor. The
Pope had ceased to be a subject, and his word had set
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page517">[pg 517]</span><a name="Pg517" id="Pg517" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a Teuton sovereign on full equality with the power
which had so grievously maltreated Italy during two
hundred years. Never could he have taken such a step
had he been still a vassal of the Greek court, which had
not only tyrannised itself, but left the Apostolic See
defenceless to the Lombard aggression for many generations.
The emperor Zeno had made Odoacer Roman
Patricius for the subjugation of Italy and of Rome
itself. Stephen II. had made Pipin Patricius for its
delivery and defence of the Holy See. Leo III. had
exalted the Patricius to be emperor for fuller defence.
No Roman noble or bandit could resist the power thus
created. The Greek influence in Italy was all but
extinguished; the Roman Church was protected from
that violation of its rights, that plundering of its
property, which Cæsar and Exarch had so often inflicted.
For the patrimonies which the Isaurian had
confiscated, the Roman See was thus in another form
compensated. The Pope had received a domain in
central Italy, and was in the possession of full independence.
Over against that free life and mounting
sap of the West, the East presented but an image of
decay and stagnation.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Harun al Raschid was reigning as chalif at Bagdad
when Charles was made emperor at Rome. His troops
advanced to Ephesus and compelled the empress Irene
to pay tribute during a four years' suspension of hostilities.
Again and again had Moslem armies polluted the
Christian cities from Antioch to the Bosphorus with
every iniquity. In 726, they took possession of St.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page518">[pg 518]</span><a name="Pg518" id="Pg518" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Basil's Cæsarea, in the year when the Isaurian was
trying to force his Mohammedan hatred of images on
Pope St. Gregory II., and seven years before he was
stripping the Roman Church of its patrimony, and
transferring ten provinces of the Papal patriarchate
to the bishop of the eastern capital. From the death
of Mohammed in 632 to the creation of Charles as
emperor of the Romans in 800, was a time of scarcely
interrupted disaster inflicted by the Saracen on the
Christian through the East and the South. The outburst
began as we have seen, by the betrayal of the
faith on the part of Heraclius, the sole Roman emperor:
Constans II., Leo III., and Kopronymus continued
this betrayal. Mohammed waxed greater and greater
through this whole period. The Christian successes
consisted in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> losing Constantinople, and in saving
the south of France after the loss of Spain. In the
reign of Harun al Raschid, that most terrible of destructions
was at its greatest expansion and intensity.
Then an emperor of the Romans was created by the
Pope for the special defence of the Church. Exactly
as Harun in his character of chalif was bound to lay
waste and destroy the Christian Church and Faith,
Charles was bound to watch over it. This was the
tenure by which he held the empire, and his successors
after him.<a id="noteref_269" name="noteref_269" href="#note_269"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">269</span></span></a> It was given, not for the glory and distinction
of the wearer, but its true and proper significance
lay in the fulfilment of the duties which the
emperor was to discharge as protector of the Church.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page519">[pg 519]</span><a name="Pg519" id="Pg519" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
All imperial grandeur was an attribute of this duty.
Exactly because the Greek emperor had not fulfilled
this duty, the Pope undertook the renovation of
the western Roman empire. It would be an entirely
erroneous view of Leo's act to suppose that he could
have done nothing else, that he must have made
Charlemagne emperor, and by this single crowning
bound himself and his successors to accept every succeeding
emperor. Things in the East had come to
that pass, but in the West the whole empire, in conception
and in fact, was the Pope's work. The office
thus created was a spiritual office, to which the spiritual
head of Christendom should consecrate, anoint, and
crown its temporal head. When there was a new king
of the Franks, he was to come to Rome for consecration
as emperor of the Romans: the Pope did not elect the
new king, neither of the Franks then, nor of the
Germans afterwards, but he, and he alone, invested
the man chosen king with the title and power of the
Roman emperor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The chalifate, set up in the false pretension of succeeding
a man whose whole claim to rule was founded
on a falsehood, had become the most terrible despotism
which human history had witnessed. It had taken
possession of a very large part of what was Christian
territory when it appeared in the world. Heraclius
and his line trembled before it. At the time when
a soldier of fortune closed seven revolutions at Byzantium
Christian Spain was overwhelmed by it. And
presently the Isaurian line helped its onward march
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page520">[pg 520]</span><a name="Pg520" id="Pg520" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by arrogating to itself that intrusion into spiritual
government, which was the very basis of the chalifate.
Then the action of Leo III., on Christmas Day, 800,
created in the West a power adequate to resist the
further advance of Mohammedan rule. As long continued
dissension in the faith, decline in Christian
morals, and an ever advancing despotism had given
entrance to Saracen conquest, so from the very tomb

of nations in the faith to give one spirit to the West:
the flood which had almost overflowed the earth to
stop before the Rock of Peter.

Messrs. Burns &amp; Oates' Roman Missal
published at the end of 1912, achieved an immediate
and enormous sale, and the first large impression was
almost immediately exhausted. A second edition is
now ready, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">printed upon perfectly opaque paper</span></span>, and
the Publishers believe this to be one of the most beautiful
of modern books for its perfect typography, its size,
its shape and the beauty afforded by the use of red ink
for the rubrics throughout. A copy will be gladly
sent on approval where desired.

This minor masterpiece of the great Dominican Doctor of
the Church, now for the first time translated into English, is
elucidated in the light of modern learning by the comments of
the Jesuit translator. These Notes have placed Father
Rickaby in the first rank of annotators; and the handsome
folio page admits by its size the printing of them in direct
contact with the text to which they refer. Thus is a profound
treatise brought, for the most part, within the apprehension of
the simplest reader.

            support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number
            of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in
            machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
            including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
            particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the
            IRS.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
            charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
            States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
            we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
            DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
            visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate" class="tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
            have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
            against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
            approach us with offers to donate.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
            any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
            outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and
            addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including

            originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that
            could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and
            distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer
            support.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of
            which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
            notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in
            compliance with any particular paper edition.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
            eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
            compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corrected <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our eBooks replace the old file
            and take over the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file
            is renamed. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Versions</span></em> based on separate sources are treated
            as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
